<div class="subhead">DR. SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Ferrars</span> died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I
    was sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There
    was nothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.</p>
<p>It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I
    opened the front door with my latch-key, and purposely delayed a few
    moments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that
    I had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn
    morning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am
    not going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the
    next few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me
    that there were stirring times ahead.</p>
<p>From the dining-room on my left there came the rattle of tea-cups and
    the short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.</p>
<p>“Is that you, James?” she called.</p>
<p>An unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the
    truth, it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few
    minutes’ delay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells
    us, is: “Go and find out.” If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should
    certainly suggest a mongoose rampant. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> might omit the first part
    of the motto. Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting
    placidly at home. I don’t know how she manages it, but there it is. I
    suspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her Intelligence
    Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in information, but to
    spread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.</p>
<p>It was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these
    pangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise
    of Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within
    the space of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally
    aim at discretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually
    withholding all information possible from my sister. She usually finds
    out just the same, but I have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I
    am in no way to blame.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferrars’ husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has
    constantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion,
    that his wife poisoned him.</p>
<p>She scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute
    gastritis, helped on by habitual over-indulgence in alcoholic
    beverages. The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not,
    I agree, unlike, but Caroline bases her accusation on quite different
    lines.</p>
<p>“You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard her say.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive
    woman, and her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very
    well, but all the same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris and
    have not, on that account, necessarily poisoned their husbands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>
<p>As I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my
    mind, Caroline’s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.</p>
<p>“What on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don’t you come and
    get your breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Just coming, my dear,” I said hastily. “I’ve been hanging up my
    overcoat.”</p>
<p>“You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”</p>
<p>She was quite right. I could have.</p>
<p>I walked into the dining-room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on the
    cheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.</p>
<p>“You’ve had an early call,” remarked Caroline.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “King’s Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said my sister.</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Annie told me.”</p>
<p>Annie is the house parlormaid. A nice girl, but an inveterate talker.</p>
<p>There was a pause. I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister’s nose,
    which is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does
    when she is interested or excited over anything.</p>
<p>“Well?” she demanded.</p>
<p>“A bad business. Nothing to be done. Must have died in her sleep.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said my sister again.</p>
<p>This time I was annoyed.</p>
<p>“You can’t know,” I snapped. “I didn’t know myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> until I got there,
    and I haven’t mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she
    must be a clairvoyant.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the
    Ferrars’ cook.”</p>
<p>As I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information.
    She sits at home, and it comes to her.</p>
<p>My sister continued:</p>
<p>“What did she die of? Heart failure?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t the milkman tell you that?” I inquired sarcastically.</p>
<p>Sarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes it seriously and answers
    accordingly.</p>
<p>“He didn’t know,” she explained.</p>
<p>After all, Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. She might as
    well hear from me.</p>
<p>“She died of an overdose of veronal. She’s been taking it lately for
    sleeplessness. Must have taken too much.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Caroline immediately. “She took it on purpose. Don’t
    tell me!”</p>
<p>It is odd how, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do
    not wish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by some one else will rouse
    you to a fury of denial. I burst immediately into indignant speech.</p>
<p>“There you go again,” I said. “Rushing along without rhyme or reason.
    Why on earth should Mrs. Ferrars wish to commit suicide? A widow,
    fairly young still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but
    enjoy life. It’s absurd.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>
<p>“Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been
    looking lately. It’s been coming on for the last six months. She’s
    looked positively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she
    hasn’t been able to sleep.”</p>
<p>“What is your diagnosis?” I demanded coldly. “An unfortunate love
    affair, I suppose?”</p>
<p>My sister shook her head.</p>
<p>“<em>Remorse</em>,” she said, with great gusto.</p>
<p>“Remorse?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her
    husband. I’m more than ever convinced of it now.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re very logical,” I objected. “Surely if a woman
    committed a crime like murder, she’d be sufficiently cold-blooded to
    enjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as
    repentance.”</p>
<p>Caroline shook her head.</p>
<p>“There probably are women like that—but Mrs. Ferrars wasn’t one of
    them. She was a mass of nerves. An overmastering impulse drove her on
    to get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply
    can’t endure suffering of any kind, and there’s no doubt that the wife
    of a man like Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal——”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“And ever since she’s been haunted by what she did. I can’t help
    feeling sorry for her.”</p>
<p>I don’t think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs. Ferrars whilst she was
    alive. Now that she has gone where (presumably)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> Paris frocks can no
    longer be worn, Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions
    of pity and comprehension.</p>
<p>I told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. I was all the more
    firm because I secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she
    had said. But it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth
    simply by a kind of inspired guesswork. I wasn’t going to encourage
    that sort of thing. She will go round the village airing her views, and
    every one will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by
    me. Life is very trying.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Caroline, in reply to my strictures. “You’ll see. Ten
    to one she’s left a letter confessing everything.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t leave a letter of any kind,” I said sharply, and not seeing
    where the admission was going to land me.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Caroline. “So you <em>did</em> inquire about that, did you? I
    believe, James, that in your heart of hearts, you think very much as I
    do. You’re a precious old humbug.”</p>
<p>“One always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration,”
    I said repressively.</p>
<p>“Will there be an inquest?”</p>
<p>“There may be. It all depends. If I am able to declare myself
    absolutely satisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally, an
    inquest might be dispensed with.”</p>
<p>“And are you absolutely satisfied?” asked my sister shrewdly.</p>
<p>I did not answer, but got up from table.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">WHO’S WHO IN KING’S ABBOT</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> I proceed further with what I said to Caroline and what Caroline
    said to me, it might be as well to give some idea of what I should
    describe as our local geography. Our village, King’s Abbot, is, I
    imagine, very much like any other village. Our big town is Cranchester,
    nine miles away. We have a large railway station, a small post office,
    and two rival “General Stores.” Able-bodied men are apt to leave the
    place early in life, but we are rich in unmarried ladies and retired
    military officers. Our hobbies and recreations can be summed up in the
    one word, “gossip.”</p>
<p>There are only two houses of any importance in King’s Abbot. One
    is King’s Paddock, left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband. The
    other, Fernly Park, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always
    interested me by being a man more impossibly like a country squire
    than any country squire could really be. He reminds one of the
    red-faced sportsmen who always appeared early in the first act of an
    old-fashioned musical comedy, the setting being the village green. They
    usually sang a song about going up to London. Nowadays we have revues,
    and the country squire has died out of musical fashion.</p>
<p>Of course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> is an immensely
    successful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of
    nearly fifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner.
    He is hand and glove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish
    funds (though rumor has it that he is extremely mean in personal
    expenditure), encourages cricket matches, Lads’ Clubs, and Disabled
    Soldiers’ Institutes. He is, in fact, the life and soul of our peaceful
    village of King’s Abbot.</p>
<p>Now when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,
    and married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her
    name was Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the
    marriage was short and painful. To put it bluntly, Mrs. Ackroyd was
    a dipsomaniac. She succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four
    years after her marriage.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a
    second matrimonial adventure. His wife’s child by her first marriage
    was only seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five.
    Ackroyd has always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up
    accordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry
    and trouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of
    Ralph Paton in King’s Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for
    one thing.</p>
<p>As I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village.
    Everybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on
    very well together. After her husband’s death, the intimacy became
    more marked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
    conjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs. Ferrars
    would become Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a
    certain fitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd’s wife had admittedly died
    of drink. Ashley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his
    death. It was only fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess
    should make up to each other for all that they had previously endured
    at the hands of their former spouses.</p>
<p>The Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of
    gossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that
    Ralph Paton was growing up to manhood, a series of lady housekeepers
    presided over Ackroyd’s establishment, and each in turn was regarded
    with lively suspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too
    much to say that for at least fifteen years the whole village has
    confidently expected Ackroyd to marry one of his housekeepers. The last
    of them, a redoubtable lady called Miss Russell, has reigned undisputed
    for five years, twice as long as any of her predecessors. It is felt
    that but for the advent of Mrs. Ferrars, Ackroyd could hardly have
    escaped. That—and one other factor—the unexpected arrival of a widowed
    sister-in-law with her daughter from Canada. Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, widow
    of Ackroyd’s ne’er-do-well younger brother, has taken up her residence
    at Fernly Park, and has succeeded, according to Caroline, in putting
    Miss Russell in her proper place.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what a “proper place” constitutes—it sounds chilly
    and unpleasant—but I know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> Miss Russell goes about with pinched
    lips, and what I can only describe as an acid smile, and that she
    professes the utmost sympathy for “poor Mrs. Ackroyd—dependent on the
    charity of her husband’s brother. The bread of charity is so bitter,
    is it not? <em>I</em> should be quite miserable if I did not work for my
    living.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Ferrars affair when
    it came on the tapis. It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd
    should remain unmarried. She was always very charming—not to say
    gushing—to Mrs. Ferrars when they met. Caroline says that proves less
    than nothing.</p>
<p>Such have been our preoccupations in King’s Abbot for the last few
    years. We have discussed Ackroyd and his affairs from every standpoint.
    Mrs. Ferrars has fitted into her place in the scheme.</p>
<p>Now there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope. From a mild
    discussion of probable wedding presents, we have been jerked into the
    midst of tragedy.</p>
<p>Revolving these and sundry other matters in my mind, I went
    mechanically on my round. I had no cases of special interest to attend,
    which was, perhaps, as well, for my thoughts returned again and again
    to the mystery of Mrs. Ferrars’s death. Had she taken her own life?
    Surely, if she had done so, she would have left some word behind to
    say what she contemplated doing? Women, in my experience, if they once
    reach the determination to commit suicide, usually wish to reveal the
    state of mind that led to the fatal action. They covet the limelight.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>
<p>When had I last seen her? Not for over a week. Her manner then had been
    normal enough considering—well—considering everything.</p>
<p>Then I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though not to speak
    to, only yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had
    been surprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in
    King’s Abbot. I thought, indeed, that he had quarreled finally with
    his stepfather. Nothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six
    months. They had been walking along, side by side, their heads close
    together, and she had been talking very earnestly.</p>
<p>I think I can safely say that it was at this moment that a foreboding
    of the future first swept over me. Nothing tangible as yet—but a
    vague premonition of the way things were setting. That earnest
    <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> between Ralph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars the day before
    struck me disagreeably.</p>
<p>I was still thinking of it when I came face to face with Roger Ackroyd.</p>
<p>“Sheppard!” he exclaimed. “Just the man I wanted to get hold of. This
    is a terrible business.”</p>
<p>“You’ve heard then?”</p>
<p>He nodded. He had felt the blow keenly, I could see. His big red cheeks
    seemed to have fallen in, and he looked a positive wreck of his usual
    jolly, healthy self.</p>
<p>“It’s worse than you know,” he said quietly. “Look here, Sheppard, I’ve
    got to talk to you. Can you come back with me now?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>
<p>“Hardly. I’ve got three patients to see still, and I must be back by
    twelve to see my surgery patients.”</p>
<p>“Then this afternoon—no, better still, dine to-night. At 7.30? Will
    that suit you?”</p>
<p>“Yes—I can manage that all right. What’s wrong? Is it Ralph?”</p>
<p>I hardly knew why I said that—except, perhaps, that it had so often
    been Ralph.</p>
<p>Ackroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood. I began to
    realize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere. I had
    never seen Ackroyd so upset before.</p>
<p>“Ralph?” he said vaguely. “Oh! no, it’s not Ralph. Ralph’s in
    London——Damn! Here’s old Miss Ganett coming. I don’t want to have to
    talk to her about this ghastly business. See you to-night, Sheppard.
    Seven-thirty.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and he hurried away, leaving me wondering. Ralph in London?
    But he had certainly been in King’s Abbot the preceding afternoon. He
    must have gone back to town last night or early this morning, and yet
    Ackroyd’s manner had conveyed quite a different impression. He had
    spoken as though Ralph had not been near the place for months.</p>
<p>I had no time to puzzle the matter out further. Miss Ganett was upon
    me, thirsting for information. Miss Ganett has all the characteristics
    of my sister Caroline, but she lacks that unerring aim in jumping to
    conclusions which lends a touch of greatness to Caroline’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> maneuvers.
    Miss Ganett was breathless and interrogatory.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it sad about poor dear Mrs. Ferrars? A lot of people were saying
    she had been a confirmed drug-taker for years. So wicked the way
    people went about saying things. And yet, the worst of it was, there
    was usually a grain of truth somewhere in these wild statements. No
    smoke without fire! They were saying too that Mr. Ackroyd had found out
    about it, and had broken off the engagement—because there <em>was</em>
    an engagement. She, Miss Ganett, had proof positive of that. Of course
    <em>I</em> must know all about it—doctors always did—but they never tell?</p>
<p>And all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how I reacted to
    these suggestions. Fortunately long association with Caroline has led
    me to preserve an impassive countenance, and to be ready with small
    non-committal remarks.</p>
<p>On this occasion I congratulated Miss Ganett on not joining in
    ill-natured gossip. Rather a neat counterattack, I thought. It left
    her in difficulties, and before she could pull herself together, I had
    passed on.</p>
<p>I went home thoughtful, to find several patients waiting for me in the
    surgery.</p>
<p>I had dismissed the last of them, as I thought, and was just
    contemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I perceived
    one more patient waiting for me. She rose and came towards me as I
    stood somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I should have been, except that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> is a suggestion
    of cast iron about Miss Russell, a something that is above the ills of
    the flesh.</p>
<p>Ackroyd’s housekeeper is a tall woman, handsome but forbidding in
    appearance. She has a stern eye, and lips that shut tightly, and I feel
    that if I were an under housemaid or a kitchenmaid I should run for my
    life whenever I heard her coming.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Dr. Sheppard,” said Miss Russell. “I should be much
    obliged if you would take a look at my knee.”</p>
<p>I took a look, but, truth to tell, I was very little wiser when I had
    done so. Miss Russell’s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that
    with a woman of less integrity of character I should have suspected a
    trumped-up tale. It did cross my mind for one moment that Miss Russell
    might have deliberately invented this affection of the knee in order
    to pump me on the subject of Mrs. Ferrars’s death, but I soon saw that
    there, at least, I had misjudged her. She made a brief reference to the
    tragedy, nothing more. Yet she certainly seemed disposed to linger and
    chat.</p>
<p>“Well, thank you very much for this bottle of liniment, doctor,” she
    said at last. “Not that I believe it will do the least good.”</p>
<p>I didn’t think it would either, but I protested in duty bound. After
    all, it couldn’t do any harm, and one must stick up for the tools of
    one’s trade.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in all these drugs,” said Miss Russell, her eyes
    sweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> “Drugs do a lot of
    harm. Look at the cocaine habit.”</p>
<p>“Well, as far as that goes——”</p>
<p>“It’s very prevalent in high society.”</p>
<p>I’m sure Miss Russell knows far more about high society than I do. I
    didn’t attempt to argue with her.</p>
<p>“Just tell me this, doctor,” said Miss Russell. “Suppose you are really
    a slave of the drug habit. Is there any cure?”</p>
<p>One cannot answer a question like that offhand. I gave her a short
    lecture on the subject, and she listened with close attention. I still
    suspected her of seeking information about Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
<p>“Now, veronal, for instance——” I proceeded.</p>
<p>But, strangely enough, she didn’t seem interested in veronal. Instead
    she changed the subject, and asked me if it was true that there were
    certain poisons so rare as to baffle detection.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I said. “You’ve been reading detective stories.”</p>
<p>She admitted that she had.</p>
<p>“The essence of a detective story,” I said, “is to have a rare
    poison—if possible something from South America, that nobody has ever
    heard of—something that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison
    their arrows with. Death is instantaneous, and Western science is
    powerless to detect it. That is the kind of thing you mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Is there really such a thing?”</p>
<p>I shook my head regretfully.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t. There’s <em>curare</em>, of course.”</p>
<p>I told her a good deal about curare, but she seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> have lost
    interest once more. She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard,
    and when I replied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.</p>
<p>She said she must be getting back, and I saw her out at the surgery
    door just as the luncheon gong went.</p>
<p>I should never have suspected Miss Russell of a fondness for detective
    stories. It pleases me very much to think of her stepping out of the
    housekeeper’s room to rebuke a delinquent housemaid, and then returning
    to a comfortable perusal of <cite>The Mystery of the Seventh Death</cite>, or
    something of the kind.</p>

<div class="subhead">THE MAN WHO GREW VEGETABLE MARROWS</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I told</span> Caroline at lunch time that I should be dining at Fernly. She
    expressed no objection—on the contrary——</p>
<p>“Excellent,” she said. “You’ll hear all about it. By the way, what is
    the trouble with Ralph?”</p>
<p>“With Ralph?” I said, surprised; “there’s isn’t any.”</p>
<p>“Then why is he staying at the Three Boars instead of at Fernly Park?”</p>
<p>I did not for a minute question Caroline’s statement that Ralph Paton
    was staying at the local inn. That Caroline said so was enough for me.</p>
<p>“Ackroyd told me he was in London,” I said. In the surprise of
    the moment I departed from my valuable rule of never parting with
    information.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Caroline. I could see her nose twitching as she worked on
    this.</p>
<p>“He arrived at the Three Boars yesterday morning,” she said. “And he’s
    still there. Last night he was out with a girl.”</p>
<p>That did not surprise me in the least. Ralph, I should say, is out
    with a girl most nights of his life. But I did rather wonder that he
    chose to indulge in the pastime in King’s Abbot instead of in the gay
    metropolis.</p>
<p>“One of the barmaids?” I asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>
<p>“No. That’s just it. He went out to meet her. I don’t know who she is.”</p>
<p>(Bitter for Caroline to have to admit such a thing.)</p>
<p>“But I can guess,” continued my indefatigable sister.</p>
<p>I waited patiently.</p>
<p>“His cousin.”</p>
<p>“Flora Ackroyd?” I exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Flora Ackroyd is, of course, no relation whatever really to Ralph
    Paton, but Ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically
    Ackroyd’s own son, that cousinship is taken for granted.</p>
<p>“Flora Ackroyd,” said my sister.</p>
<p>“But why not go to Fernly if he wanted to see her?”</p>
<p>“Secretly engaged,” said Caroline, with immense enjoyment. “Old Ackroyd
    won’t hear of it, and they have to meet this way.”</p>
<p>I saw a good many flaws in Caroline’s theory, but I forbore to point
    them out to her. An innocent remark about our new neighbor created a
    diversion.</p>
<p>The house next door, The Larches, has recently been taken by a
    stranger. To Caroline’s extreme annoyance, she has not been able
    to find out anything about him, except that he is a foreigner. The
    Intelligence Corps has proved a broken reed. Presumably the man has
    milk and vegetables and joints of meat and occasional whitings just
    like everybody else, but none of the people who make it their business
    to supply these things seem to have acquired any information. His name,
    apparently, is Mr. Porrott—a name which conveys an odd feeling of
    unreality. The one thing we do know about him is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> he is interested
    in the growing of vegetable marrows.</p>
<p>But that is certainly not the sort of information that Caroline is
    after. She wants to know where he comes from, what he does, whether he
    is married, what his wife was, or is, like, whether he has children,
    what his mother’s maiden name was—and so on. Somebody very like
    Caroline must have invented the questions on passports, I think.</p>
<p>“My dear Caroline,” I said. “There’s no doubt at all about what the
    man’s profession has been. He’s a retired hairdresser. Look at that
    mustache of his.”</p>
<p>Caroline dissented. She said that if the man was a hairdresser, he
    would have wavy hair—not straight. All hairdressers did.</p>
<p>I cited several hairdressers personally known to me who had straight
    hair, but Caroline refused to be convinced.</p>
<p>“I can’t make him out at all,” she said in an aggrieved voice. “I
    borrowed some garden tools the other day, and he was most polite, but
    I couldn’t get anything out of him. I asked him point blank at last
    whether he was a Frenchman, and he said he wasn’t—and somehow I didn’t
    like to ask him any more.”</p>
<p>I began to be more interested in our mysterious neighbor. A man who
    is capable of shutting up Caroline and sending her, like the Queen of
    Sheba, empty away must be something of a personality.</p>
<p>“I believe,” said Caroline, “that he’s got one of those new vacuum
    cleaners——”</p>
<p>I saw a meditated loan and the opportunity of further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> questioning
    gleaming from her eye. I seized the chance to escape into the garden.
    I am rather fond of gardening. I was busily exterminating dandelion
    roots when a shout of warning sounded from close by and a heavy body
    whizzed by my ear and fell at my feet with a repellant squelch. It was
    a vegetable marrow!</p>
<p>I looked up angrily. Over the wall, to my left, there appeared a face.
    An egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two
    immense mustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes. It was our mysterious
    neighbor, Mr. Porrott.</p>
<p>He broke at once into fluent apologies.</p>
<p>“I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defense.
    For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly
    I enrage myself with these marrows. I send them to promenade
    themselves—alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest.
    I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.”</p>
<p>Before such profuse apologies, my anger was forced to melt. After
    all, the wretched vegetable hadn’t hit me. But I sincerely hoped that
    throwing large vegetables over walls was not our new friend’s hobby.
    Such a habit could hardly endear him to us as a neighbor.</p>
<p>The strange little man seemed to read my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Ah! no,” he exclaimed. “Do not disquiet yourself. It is not with me a
    habit. But can you figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work
    towards a certain object, may labor and toil to attain a certain kind
    of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns
    for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself
    so glad to leave?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said slowly. “I fancy that that is a common enough occurrence.
    I myself am perhaps an instance. A year ago I came into a legacy—enough
    to enable me to realize a dream. I have always wanted to travel, to see
    the world. Well, that was a year ago, as I said, and—I am still here.”</p>
<p>My little neighbor nodded.</p>
<p>“The chains of habit. We work to attain an object, and the object
    gained, we find that what we miss is the daily toil. And mark you,
    monsieur, my work was interesting work. The most interesting work there
    is in the world.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” I said encouragingly. For the moment the spirit of Caroline was
    strong within me.</p>
<p>“The study of human nature, monsieur!”</p>
<p>“Just so,” I said kindly.</p>
<p>Clearly a retired hairdresser. Who knows the secrets of human nature
    better than a hairdresser?</p>
<p>“Also, I had a friend—a friend who for many years never left my side.
    Occasionally of an imbecility to make one afraid, nevertheless he was
    very dear to me. Figure to yourself that I miss even his stupidity.
    His <i lang="fr">naïveté</i>, his honest outlook, the pleasure of delighting and
    surprising him by my superior gifts—all these I miss more than I can
    tell you.”</p>
<p>“He died?” I asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>“Not so. He lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world. He
    is now in the Argentine.”</p>
<p>“In the Argentine,” I said enviously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>
<p>I have always wanted to go to South America. I sighed, and then
    looked up to find Mr. Porrott eyeing me sympathetically. He seemed an
    understanding little man.</p>
<p>“You will go there, yes?” he asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I could have gone,” I said, “a year ago. But I was foolish—and worse
    than foolish—greedy. I risked the substance for the shadow.”</p>
<p>“I comprehend,” said Mr. Porrott. “You speculated?”</p>
<p>I nodded mournfully, but in spite of myself I felt secretly
    entertained. This ridiculous little man was so portentously solemn.</p>
<p>“Not the Porcupine Oilfields?” he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>I stared.</p>
<p>“I thought of them, as a matter of fact, but in the end I plumped for a
    gold mine in Western Australia.”</p>
<p>My neighbor was regarding me with a strange expression which I could
    not fathom.</p>
<p>“It is Fate,” he said at last.</p>
<p>“What is Fate?” I asked irritably.</p>
<p>“That I should live next to a man who seriously considers Porcupine
    Oilfields, and also West Australian Gold Mines. Tell me, have you also
    a penchant for auburn hair?”</p>
<p>I stared at him open-mouthed, and he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“No, no, it is not the insanity that I suffer from. Make your mind
    easy. It was a foolish question that I put to you there, for, see you,
    my friend of whom I spoke was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> a young man, a man who thought all women
    good, and most of them beautiful. But you are a man of middle age, a
    doctor, a man who knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this
    life of ours. Well, well, we are neighbors. I beg of you to accept and
    present to your excellent sister my best marrow.”</p>
<p>He stooped, and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the
    tribe, which I duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said the little man cheerfully, “this has not been a wasted
    morning. I have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways
    resembles my far-off friend. By the way, I should like to ask you a
    question. You doubtless know every one in this tiny village. Who is the
    young man with the very dark hair and eyes, and the handsome face. He
    walks with his head flung back, and an easy smile on his lips?”</p>
<p>The description left me in no doubt.</p>
<p>“That must be Captain Ralph Paton,” I said slowly.</p>
<p>“I have not seen him about here before?”</p>
<p>“No, he has not been here for some time. But he is the son—adopted son,
    rather—of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park.”</p>
<p>My neighbor made a slight gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>“Of course, I should have guessed. Mr. Ackroyd spoke of him many times.”</p>
<p>“You know Mr. Ackroyd?” I said, slightly surprised.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd knew me in London—when I was at work there. I have asked
    him to say nothing of my profession down here.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>
<p>“I see,” I said, rather amused by this patent snobbery, as I thought it.</p>
<p>But the little man went on with an almost grandiloquent smirk.</p>
<p>“One prefers to remain incognito. I am not anxious for notoriety. I
    have not even troubled to correct the local version of my name.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” I said, not knowing quite what to say.</p>
<p>“Captain Ralph Paton,” mused Mr. Porrott. “And so he is engaged to Mr.
    Ackroyd’s niece, the charming Miss Flora.”</p>
<p>“Who told you so?” I asked, very much surprised.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd. About a week ago. He is very pleased about it—has long
    desired that such a thing should come to pass, or so I understood
    from him. I even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon
    the young man. That is never wise. A young man should marry to please
    himself—not to please a stepfather from whom he has expectations.”</p>
<p>My ideas were completely upset. I could not see Ackroyd taking a
    hairdresser into his confidence, and discussing the marriage of his
    niece and stepson with him. Ackroyd extends a genial patronage to the
    lower orders, but he has a very great sense of his own dignity. I began
    to think that Porrott couldn’t be a hairdresser after all.</p>
<p>To hide my confusion, I said the first thing that came into my head.</p>
<p>“What made you notice Ralph Paton? His good looks?”</p>
<p>“No, not that alone—though he is unusually good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> for an
    Englishman—what your lady novelists would call a Greek God. No, there
    was something about that young man that I did not understand.”</p>
<p>He said the last sentence in a musing tone of voice which made an
    indefinable impression upon me. It was as though he was summing up the
    boy by the light of some inner knowledge that I did not share. It was
    that impression that was left with me, for at that moment my sister’s
    voice called me from the house.</p>
<p>I went in. Caroline had her hat on, and had evidently just come in from
    the village. She began without preamble.</p>
<p>“I met Mr. Ackroyd.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” I said.</p>
<p>“I stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry, and anxious
    to get away.”</p>
<p>I have no doubt but that that was the case. He would feel towards
    Caroline much as he had felt towards Miss Ganett earlier in the
    day—perhaps more so. Caroline is less easy to shake off.</p>
<p>“I asked him at once about Ralph. He was absolutely astonished. Had no
    idea the boy was down here. He actually said he thought I must have
    made a mistake. I! A mistake!”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous,” I said. “He ought to have known you better.”</p>
<p>“Then he went on to tell me that Ralph and Flora are engaged.”</p>
<p>“I know that too,” I interrupted, with modest pride.</p>
<p>“Who told you?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>
<p>“Our new neighbor.”</p>
<p>Caroline visibly wavered for a second or two, much as a roulette ball
    might coyly hover between two numbers. Then she declined the tempting
    red herring.</p>
<p>“I told Mr. Ackroyd that Ralph was staying at the Three Boars.”</p>
<p>“Caroline,” I said, “do you never reflect that you might do a lot of
    harm with this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said my sister. “People ought to know things. I consider it
    my duty to tell them. Mr. Ackroyd was very grateful to me.”</p>
<p>“Well?” I said, for there was clearly more to come.</p>
<p>“I think he went straight off to the Three Boars, but if so he didn’t
    find Ralph there.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No. Because as I was coming back through the wood——”</p>
<p>“Coming back through the wood?” I interrupted.</p>
<p>Caroline had the grace to blush.</p>
<p>“It was such a lovely day,” she exclaimed. “I thought I would make a
    little round. The woods with their autumnal tints are so perfect at
    this time of year.”</p>
<p>Caroline does not care a hang for woods at any time of year. Normally
    she regards them as places where you get your feet damp, and where all
    kinds of unpleasant things may drop on your head. No, it was good sound
    mongoose instinct which took her to our local wood. It is the only
    place adjacent to the village of King’s Abbot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> where you can talk with
    a young woman unseen by the whole of the village. It adjoins the Park
    of Fernly.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “go on.”</p>
<p>“As I say, I was just coming back through the wood when I heard voices.”</p>
<p>Caroline paused.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“One was Ralph Paton’s—I knew it at once. The other was a girl’s. Of
    course I didn’t mean to listen——”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” I interjected, with patent sarcasm—which was, however,
    wasted on Caroline.</p>
<p>“But I simply couldn’t help overhearing. The girl said something—I
    didn’t quite catch what it was, and Ralph answered. He sounded very
    angry. ‘My dear girl,’ he said. ‘Don’t you realize that it is quite
    on the cards the old man will cut me off with a shilling? He’s been
    pretty fed up with me for the last few years. A little more would do
    it. And we need the dibs, my dear. I shall be a very rich man when
    the old fellow pops off. He’s mean as they make ’em, but he’s rolling
    in money really. I don’t want him to go altering his will. You leave
    it to me, and don’t worry.’ Those were his exact words. I remember
    them perfectly. Unfortunately, just then I stepped on a dry twig or
    something, and they lowered their voices and moved away. I couldn’t, of
    course, go rushing after them, so wasn’t able to see who the girl was.”</p>
<p>“That must have been most vexing,” I said. “I suppose, though, you
    hurried on to the Three Boars, felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> faint, and went into the bar for a
    glass of brandy, and so were able to see if both the barmaids were on
    duty?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a barmaid,” said Caroline unhesitatingly. “In fact, I’m
    almost sure that it was Flora Ackroyd, only——”</p>
<p>“Only it doesn’t seem to make sense,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“But if it wasn’t Flora, who could it have been?”</p>
<p>Rapidly my sister ran over a list of maidens living in the
    neighborhood, with profuse reasons for and against.</p>
<p>When she paused for breath, I murmured something about a patient, and
    slipped out.</p>
<p>I proposed to make my way to the Three Boars. It seemed likely that
    Ralph Paton would have returned there by now.</p>
<p>I knew Ralph very well—better, perhaps, than any one else in King’s
    Abbot, for I had known his mother before him, and therefore I
    understood much in him that puzzled others. He was, to a certain
    extent, the victim of heredity. He had not inherited his mother’s
    fatal propensity for drink, but nevertheless he had in him a strain
    of weakness. As my new friend of this morning had declared, he was
    extraordinarily handsome. Just on six feet, perfectly proportioned,
    with the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark, like his mother,
    with a handsome, sunburnt face always ready to break into a smile.
    Ralph Paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort. He
    was self-indulgent and extravagant, with no veneration for anything
    on earth, but he was lovable nevertheless, and his friends were all
    devoted to him.</p>
<p>Could I do anything with the boy? I thought I could.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>
<p>On inquiry at the Three Boars I found that Captain Paton had just come
    in. I went up to his room and entered unannounced.</p>
<p>For a moment, remembering what I had heard and seen, I was doubtful of
    my reception, but I need have had no misgivings.</p>
<p>“Why, it’s Sheppard! Glad to see you.”</p>
<p>He came forward to meet me, hand outstretched, a sunny smile lighting
    up his face.</p>
<p>“The one person I am glad to see in this infernal place.”</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What’s the place been doing?”</p>
<p>He gave a vexed laugh.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. Things haven’t been going well with me, doctor. But
    have a drink, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said, “I will.”</p>
<p>He pressed the bell, then, coming back, threw himself into a chair.</p>
<p>“Not to mince matters,” he said gloomily, “I’m in the devil of a mess.
    In fact, I haven’t the least idea what to do next.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” I asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>“It’s my confounded stepfather.”</p>
<p>“What has he done?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t what he’s done yet, but what he’s likely to do.”</p>
<p>The bell was answered, and Ralph ordered the drinks. When the man had
    gone again, he sat hunched in the arm-chair, frowning to himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>
<p>“Is it really—serious?” I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m fairly up against it this time,” he said soberly.</p>
<p>The unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the
    truth. It took a good deal to make Ralph grave.</p>
<p>“In fact,” he continued, “I can’t see my way ahead.... I’m damned if I
    can.”</p>
<p>“If I could help——” I suggested diffidently.</p>
<p>But he shook his head very decidedly.</p>
<p>“Good of you, doctor. But I can’t let you in on this. I’ve got to play
    a lone hand.”</p>
<p>He was silent a minute and then repeated in a slightly different tone
    of voice:—</p>
<p>“Yes—I’ve got to play a lone hand....”</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">DINNER AT FERNLY</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was just a few minutes before half-past seven when I rang the
    front door bell of Fernly Park. The door was opened with admirable
    promptitude by Parker, the butler.</p>
<p>The night was such a fine one that I had preferred to come on foot. I
    stepped into the big square hall and Parker relieved me of my overcoat.
    Just then Ackroyd’s secretary, a pleasant young fellow by the name of
    Raymond, passed through the hall on his way to Ackroyd’s study, his
    hands full of papers.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, doctor. Coming to dine? Or is this a professional call?”</p>
<p>The last was in allusion to my black bag, which I had laid down on the
    oak chest.</p>
<p>I explained that I expected a summons to a confinement case at any
    moment, and so had come out prepared for an emergency call. Raymond
    nodded, and went on his way, calling over his shoulder:—</p>
<p>“Go into the drawing-room. You know the way. The ladies will be down in
    a minute. I must just take these papers to Mr. Ackroyd, and I’ll tell
    him you’re here.”</p>
<p>On Raymond’s appearance Parker had withdrawn, so I was alone in the
    hall. I settled my tie, glanced in a large mirror which hung there, and
    crossed to the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> directly facing me, which was, as I knew, the door
    of the drawing-room.</p>
<p>I noticed, just as I was turning the handle, a sound from within—the
    shutting down of a window, I took it to be. I noted it, I may say,
    quite mechanically, without attaching any importance to it at the time.</p>
<p>I opened the door and walked in. As I did so, I almost collided with
    Miss Russell, who was just coming out. We both apologized.</p>
<p>For the first time I found myself appraising the housekeeper and
    thinking what a handsome woman she must once have been—indeed, as far
    as that goes, still was. Her dark hair was unstreaked with gray, and
    when she had a color, as she had at this minute, the stern quality of
    her looks was not so apparent.</p>
<p>Quite subconsciously I wondered whether she had been out, for she was
    breathing hard, as though she had been running.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I’m a few minutes early,” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh! I don’t think so. It’s gone half-past seven, Dr. Sheppard.” She
    paused a minute before saying, “I—didn’t know you were expected to
    dinner to-night. Mr. Ackroyd didn’t mention it.”</p>
<p>I received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in
    some way, but I couldn’t imagine why.</p>
<p>“How’s the knee?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Much the same, thank you, doctor. I must be going now. Mrs. Ackroyd
    will be down in a moment. I—I only came in here to see if the flowers
    were all right.”</p>
<p>She passed quickly out of the room. I strolled to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> window,
    wondering at her evident desire to justify her presence in the room. As
    I did so, I saw what, of course, I might have known all the time had
    I troubled to give my mind to it, namely, that the windows were long
    French ones opening on the terrace. The sound I had heard, therefore,
    could not have been that of a window being shut down.</p>
<p>Quite idly, and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for
    any other reason, I amused myself by trying to guess what could have
    caused the sound in question.</p>
<p>Coals on the fire? No, that was not the kind of noise at all. A drawer
    of the bureau pushed in? No, not that.</p>
<p>Then my eye was caught by what, I believe, is called a silver table,
    the lid of which lifts, and through the glass of which you can see the
    contents. I crossed over to it, studying the things. There were one
    or two pieces of old silver, a baby shoe belonging to King Charles
    the First, some Chinese jade figures, and quite a number of African
    implements and curios. Wanting to examine one of the jade figures more
    closely, I lifted the lid. It slipped through my fingers and fell.</p>
<p>At once I recognized the sound I had heard. It was this same table lid
    being shut down gently and carefully. I repeated the action once or
    twice for my own satisfaction. Then I lifted the lid to scrutinize the
    contents more closely.</p>
<p>I was still bending over the open silver table when Flora Ackroyd came
    into the room.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of people do not like Flora Ackroyd, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> nobody can help
    admiring her. And to her friends she can be very charming. The first
    thing that strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness. She has
    the real Scandinavian pale gold hair. Her eyes are blue—blue as the
    waters of a Norwegian fiord, and her skin is cream and roses. She has
    square, boyish shoulders and slight hips. And to a jaded medical man it
    is very refreshing to come across such perfect health.</p>
<p>A simple straight-forward English girl—I may be old-fashioned, but I
    think the genuine article takes a lot of beating.</p>
<p>Flora joined me by the silver table, and expressed heretical doubts as
    to King Charles I ever having worn the baby shoe.</p>
<p>“And anyway,” continued Miss Flora, “all this making a fuss about
    things because some one wore or used them seems to me all nonsense.
    They’re not wearing or using them now. The pen that George Eliot wrote
    <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite> with—that sort of thing—well, it’s only
    just a pen after all. If you’re really keen on George Eliot, why not
    get <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite> in a cheap edition and read it.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you never read such old out-of-date stuff, Miss Flora?”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong, Dr. Sheppard. I love <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite>.”</p>
<p>I was rather pleased to hear it. The things young women read nowadays
    and profess to enjoy positively frighten me.</p>
<p>“You haven’t congratulated me yet, Dr. Sheppard,” said Flora. “Haven’t
    you heard?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>
<p>She held out her left hand. On the third finger of it was an
    exquisitely set single pearl.</p>
<p>“I’m going to marry Ralph, you know,” she went on. “Uncle is very
    pleased. It keeps me in the family, you see.”</p>
<p>I took both her hands in mine.</p>
<p>“My dear,” I said, “I hope you’ll be very happy.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been engaged for about a month,” continued Flora in her cool
    voice, “but it was only announced yesterday. Uncle is going to do up
    Cross-stones, and give it to us to live in, and we’re going to pretend
    to farm. Really, we shall hunt all the winter, town for the season, and
    then go yachting. I love the sea. And, of course, I shall take a great
    interest in the parish affairs, and attend all the Mothers’ Meetings.”</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Ackroyd rustled in, full of apologies for being late.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say I detest Mrs. Ackroyd. She is all chains and teeth
    and bones. A most unpleasant woman. She has small pale flinty blue
    eyes, and however gushing her words may be, those eyes of hers always
    remain coldly speculative.</p>
<p>I went across to her, leaving Flora by the window. She gave me a
    handful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze, and began talking
    volubly.</p>
<p>Had I heard about Flora’s engagement? So suitable in every way. The
    dear young things had fallen in love at first sight. Such a perfect
    pair, he so dark and she so fair.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you, my dear Dr. Sheppard, the relief to a mother’s
    heart.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd sighed—a tribute to her mother’s heart, whilst her eyes
    remained shrewdly observant of me.</p>
<p>“I was wondering. You are such an old friend of dear Roger’s. We
    know how much he trusts to your judgment. So difficult for me—in
    my position, as poor Cecil’s widow. But there are so many tiresome
    things—settlements, you know—all that. I fully believe that Roger
    intends to make settlements upon dear Flora, but, as you know, he is
    just a <em>leetle</em> peculiar about money. Very usual, I’ve heard,
    amongst men who are captains of industry. I wondered, you know, if you
    could just <em>sound</em> him on the subject? Flora is so fond of you. We
    feel you are quite an old friend, although we have only really known
    you just over two years.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd’s eloquence was cut short as the drawing-room door opened
    once more. I was pleased at the interruption. I hate interfering in
    other people’s affairs, and I had not the least intention of tackling
    Ackroyd on the subject of Flora’s settlements. In another moment I
    should have been forced to tell Mrs. Ackroyd as much.</p>
<p>“You know Major Blunt, don’t you, doctor?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” I said.</p>
<p>A lot of people know Hector Blunt—at least by repute. He has shot more
    wild animals in unlikely places than any man living, I suppose. When
    you mention him, people say: “Blunt—you don’t mean the big game man, do
    you?”</p>
<p>His friendship with Ackroyd has always puzzled me a little. The two men
    are so totally dissimilar. Hector Blunt is perhaps five years Ackroyd’s
    junior. They made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> friends early in life, and though their ways have
    diverged, the friendship still holds. About once in two years Blunt
    spends a fortnight at Fernly, and an immense animal’s head, with an
    amazing number of horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon
    as you come inside the front door, is a permanent reminder of the
    friendship.</p>
<p>Blunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar, deliberate, yet
    soft-footed tread. He is a man of medium height, sturdily and rather
    stockily built. His face is almost mahogany-colored, and is peculiarly
    expressionless. He has gray eyes that give the impression of always
    watching something that is happening very far away. He talks little,
    and what he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced
    out of him unwillingly.</p>
<p>He said now: “How are you, Sheppard?” in his usual abrupt fashion, and
    then stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as
    though he saw something very interesting happening in Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>“Major Blunt,” said Flora, “I wish you’d tell me about these African
    things. I’m sure you know what they all are.”</p>
<p>I have heard Hector Blunt described as a woman hater, but I noticed
    that he joined Flora at the silver table with what might be described
    as alacrity. They bent over it together.</p>
<p>I was afraid Mrs. Ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again,
    so I made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea. I knew there
    was a new sweet pea because the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> had told me so that
    morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> Mrs. Ackroyd knows nothing about horticulture, but she is
    the kind of woman who likes to appear well-informed about the topics
    of the day, and she, too, reads the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>. We were able to
    converse quite intelligently until Ackroyd and his secretary joined us,
    and immediately afterwards Parker announced dinner.</p>
<p>My place at table was between Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora. Blunt was on Mrs.
    Ackroyd’s other side, and Geoffrey Raymond next to him.</p>
<p>Dinner was not a cheerful affair. Ackroyd was visibly preoccupied. He
    looked wretched, and ate next to nothing. Mrs. Ackroyd, Raymond, and
    I kept the conversation going. Flora seemed affected by her uncle’s
    depression, and Blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.</p>
<p>Immediately after dinner Ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led
    me off to his study.</p>
<p>“Once we’ve had coffee, we shan’t be disturbed again,” he explained. “I
    told Raymond to see to it that we shouldn’t be interrupted.”</p>
<p>I studied him quietly without appearing to do so. He was clearly under
    the influence of some strong excitement. For a minute or two he paced
    up and down the room, then, as Parker entered with the coffee tray, he
    sank into an arm-chair in front of the fire.</p>
<p>The study was a comfortable apartment. Book-shelves lined one wall of
    it. The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. A large desk
    stood by the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and
    filed. On a round table were various magazines and sporting papers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>
<p>“I’ve had a return of that pain after food lately,” remarked Ackroyd
    casually, as he helped himself to coffee. “You must give me some more
    of those tablets of yours.”</p>
<p>It struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our
    conference was a medical one. I played up accordingly.</p>
<p>“I thought as much. I brought some up with me.”</p>
<p>“Good man. Hand them over now.”</p>
<p>“They’re in my bag in the hall. I’ll get them.”</p>
<p>Ackroyd arrested me.</p>
<p>“Don’t you trouble. Parker will get them. Bring in the doctor’s bag,
    will you, Parker?”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>
<p>Parker withdrew. As I was about to speak, Ackroyd threw up his hand.</p>
<p>“Not yet. Wait. Don’t you see I’m in such a state of nerves that I can
    hardly contain myself?”</p>
<p>I saw that plainly enough. And I was very uneasy. All sorts of
    forebodings assailed me.</p>
<p>Ackroyd spoke again almost immediately.</p>
<p>“Make certain that window’s closed, will you?” he asked.</p>
<p>Somewhat surprised, I got up and went to it. It was not a French
    window, but one of the ordinary sash type. The heavy blue velvet
    curtains were drawn in front of it, but the window itself was open at
    the top.</p>
<p>Parker reëntered the room with my bag while I was still at the window.</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” I said, emerging again into the room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>
<p>“You’ve put the latch across?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. What’s the matter with you, Ackroyd?”</p>
<p>The door had just closed behind Parker, or I would not have put the
    question.</p>
<p>Ackroyd waited just a minute before replying.</p>
<p>“I’m in hell,” he said slowly, after a minute. “No, don’t bother with
    those damned tablets. I only said that for Parker. Servants are so
    curious. Come here and sit down. The door’s closed too, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Nobody can overhear; don’t be uneasy.”</p>
<p>“Sheppard, nobody knows what I’ve gone through in the last twenty-four
    hours. If a man’s house ever fell in ruins about him, mine has about
    me. This business of Ralph’s is the last straw. But we won’t talk about
    that now. It’s the other—the other——! I don’t know what to do about it.
    And I’ve got to make up my mind soon.”</p>
<p>“What’s the trouble?”</p>
<p>Ackroyd remained silent for a minute or two. He seemed curiously averse
    to begin. When he did speak, the question he asked came as a complete
    surprise. It was the last thing I expected.</p>
<p>“Sheppard, you attended Ashley Ferrars in his last illness, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>He seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.</p>
<p>“Did you never suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well, that he
    might have been poisoned?”</p>
<p>I was silent for a minute or two. Then I made up my mind what to say.
    Roger Ackroyd was not Caroline.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>
<p>“I’ll tell you the truth,” I said. “At the time I had no suspicion
    whatever, but since—well, it was mere idle talk on my sister’s part
    that first put the idea into my head. Since then I haven’t been able to
    get it out again. But, mind you, I’ve no foundation whatever for that
    suspicion.”</p>
<p>“He <em>was</em> poisoned,” said Ackroyd.</p>
<p>He spoke in a dull heavy voice.</p>
<p>“Who by?” I asked sharply.</p>
<p>“His wife.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?”</p>
<p>“She told me so herself.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday! My God! yesterday! It seems ten years ago.”</p>
<p>I waited a minute, and then he went on.</p>
<p>“You understand, Sheppard, I’m telling you this in confidence. It’s to
    go no further. I want your advice—I can’t carry the whole weight by
    myself. As I said just now, I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me the whole story?” I said. “I’m still in the dark. How
    did Mrs. Ferrars come to make this confession to you?”</p>
<p>“It’s like this. Three months ago I asked Mrs. Ferrars to marry me.
    She refused. I asked her again and she consented, but she refused to
    allow me to make the engagement public until her year of mourning was
    up. Yesterday I called upon her, pointed out that a year and three
    weeks had now elapsed since her husband’s death, and that there could
    be no further objection to making the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> engagement public property. I
    had noticed that she had been very strange in her manner for some days.
    Now, suddenly, without the least warning, she broke down completely.
    She—she told me everything. Her hatred of her brute of a husband, her
    growing love for me, and the—the dreadful means she had taken. Poison!
    My God! It was murder in cold blood.”</p>
<p>I saw the repulsion, the horror, in Ackroyd’s face. So Mrs. Ferrars
    must have seen it. Ackroyd is not the type of the great lover who can
    forgive all for love’s sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All
    that was sound and wholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned
    from her utterly in that moment of revelation.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he went on, in a low, monotonous voice, “she confessed
    everything. It seems that there is one person who has known all
    along—who has been blackmailing her for huge sums. It was the strain of
    that that drove her nearly mad.”</p>
<p>“Who was the man?”</p>
<p>Suddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of Ralph Paton and Mrs.
    Ferrars side by side. Their heads so close together. I felt a momentary
    throb of anxiety. Supposing—oh! but surely that was impossible. I
    remembered the frankness of Ralph’s greeting that very afternoon.
    Absurd!</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t tell me his name,” said Ackroyd slowly. “As a matter of
    fact, she didn’t actually say that it was a man. But of course——”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I agreed. “It must have been a man. And you’ve no
    suspicion at all?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>
<p>For answer Ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands.</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” he said. “I’m mad even to think of such a thing. No, I
    won’t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind. I’ll
    tell you this much, though. Something she said made me think that the
    person in question might be actually among my household—but that can’t
    be so. I must have misunderstood her.”</p>
<p>“What did you say to her?” I asked.</p>
<p>“What could I say? She saw, of course, the awful shock it had been to
    me. And then there was the question, what was my duty in the matter?
    She had made me, you see, an accessory after the fact. She saw all
    that, I think, quicker than I did. I was stunned, you know. She asked
    me for twenty-four hours—made me promise to do nothing till the end
    of that time. And she steadfastly refused to give me the name of the
    scoundrel who had been blackmailing her. I suppose she was afraid that
    I might go straight off and hammer him, and then the fat would have
    been in the fire as far as she was concerned. She told me that I should
    hear from her before twenty-four hours had passed. My God! I swear to
    you, Sheppard, that it never entered my head what she meant to do.
    Suicide! And I drove her to it.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” I said. “Don’t take an exaggerated view of things. The
    responsibility for her death doesn’t lie at your door.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what am I to do now? The poor lady is dead. Why rake
    up past trouble?”</p>
<p>“I rather agree with you,” I said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>
<p>“But there’s another point. How am I to get hold of that scoundrel who
    drove her to death as surely as if he’d killed her. He knew of the
    first crime, and he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture. She’s
    paid the penalty. Is he to go scot-free?”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said slowly. “You want to hunt him down? It will mean a lot
    of publicity, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve thought of that. I’ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind.”</p>
<p>“I agree with you that the villain ought to be punished, but the cost
    has got to be reckoned.”</p>
<p>Ackroyd rose and walked up and down. Presently he sank into the chair
    again.</p>
<p>“Look here, Sheppard, suppose we leave it like this. If no word comes
    from her, we’ll let the dead things lie.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by word coming from her?” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>“I have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must
    have left a message for me—before she went. I can’t argue about it, but
    there it is.”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“She left no letter or word of any kind. I asked.”</p>
<p>“Sheppard, I’m convinced that she did. And more, I’ve a feeling that by
    deliberately choosing death, she wanted the whole thing to come out, if
    only to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation. I believe
    that if I could have seen her then, she would have told me his name and
    bid me go for him for all I was worth.”</p>
<p>He looked at me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>
<p>“You don’t believe in impressions?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I do, in a sense. If, as you put it, word should come from
    her——”</p>
<p>I broke off. The door opened noiselessly and Parker entered with a
    salver on which were some letters.</p>
<p>“The evening post, sir,” he said, handing the salver to Ackroyd.</p>
<p>Then he collected the coffee cups and withdrew.</p>
<p>My attention, diverted for a moment, came back to Ackroyd. He was
    staring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope. The other
    letters he had let drop to the ground.</p>
<p>“<em>Her writing</em>,” he said in a whisper. “She must have gone out and
    posted it last night, just before—before——”</p>
<p>He ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure. Then he
    looked up sharply.</p>
<p>“You’re sure you shut the window?” he said.</p>
<p>“Quite sure,” I said, surprised. “Why?”</p>
<p>“All this evening I’ve had a queer feeling of being watched, spied
    upon. What’s that——?”</p>
<p>He turned sharply. So did I. We both had the impression of hearing the
    latch of the door give ever so slightly. I went across to it and opened
    it. There was no one there.</p>
<p>“Nerves,” murmured Ackroyd to himself.</p>
<p>He unfolded the thick sheets of paper, and read aloud in a low voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>“<i>My dear, my very dear Roger,—A life calls for a life. I see
      that—I saw it in your face this afternoon. So I am taking the only
      road open to me. I leave to you the punishment of the person who
      has made my life a hell upon earth for the last year. I would not
      tell you the name this afternoon, but I propose to write it to you
      now. I have no children or near relations to be spared, so do not
      fear publicity. If you can, Roger, my very dear Roger, forgive me
      the wrong I meant to do you, since when the time came, I could not
      do it after all....</i>”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ackroyd, his finger on the sheet to turn it over, paused.</p>
<p>“Sheppard, forgive me, but I must read this alone,” he said unsteadily.
    “It was meant for my eyes, and my eyes only.”</p>
<p>He put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>“Later, when I am alone.”</p>
<p>“No,” I cried impulsively, “read it now.”</p>
<p>Ackroyd stared at me in some surprise.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon,” I said, reddening. “I do not mean read it aloud to
    me. But read it through whilst I am still here.”</p>
<p>Ackroyd shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, I’d rather wait.”</p>
<p>But for some reason, obscure to myself, I continued to urge him.</p>
<p>“At least, read the name of the man,” I said.</p>
<p>Now Ackroyd is essentially pig-headed. The more you urge him to do a
    thing, the more determined he is not to do it. All my arguments were in
    vain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>
<p>The letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just
    on ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I
    hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering
    if there was anything I had left undone. I could think of nothing. With
    a shake of the head I passed out and closed the door behind me.</p>
<p>I was startled by seeing the figure of Parker close at hand. He looked
    embarrassed, and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at
    the door.</p>
<p>What a fat, smug, oily face the man had, and surely there was something
    decidedly shifty in his eye.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed,” I said
    coldly. “He told me to tell you so.”</p>
<p>“Quite so, sir. I—I fancied I heard the bell ring.”</p>
<p>This was such a palpable untruth that I did not trouble to reply.
    Preceding me to the hall, Parker helped me on with my overcoat, and I
    stepped out into the night. The moon was overcast and everything seemed
    very dark and still. The village church clock chimed nine o’clock
    as I passed through the lodge gates. I turned to the left towards
    the village, and almost cannoned into a man coming in the opposite
    direction.</p>
<p>“This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse
    voice.</p>
<p>I looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and
    his coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face,
    but he seemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.</p>
<p>“These are the lodge gates here,” I said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>
<p>“Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily,
    “I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”</p>
<p>He went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.</p>
<p>The odd thing was that his voice reminded me of some one’s voice that I
    knew, but whose it was I could not think.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of
    curiosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a
    slightly fictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and
    I had an uneasy feeling that she saw through the transparent device.</p>
<p>At ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.</p>
<p>It was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as
    usual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked
    up the kitchen properly.</p>
<p>It was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached
    the top when the telephone rang in the hall below.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Bates,” said Caroline immediately.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so,” I said ruefully.</p>
<p>I ran down the stairs and took up the receiver.</p>
<p>“What?” I said. “<em>What?</em> Certainly, I’ll come at once.”</p>
<p>I ran upstairs, caught up my bag, and stuffed a few extra dressings
    into it.</p>
<p>“Parker telephoning,” I shouted to Caroline, “from Fernly. They’ve just
    found Roger Ackroyd murdered.”</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">MURDER</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I got</span> out the car in next to no time, and drove rapidly to Fernly.
    Jumping out, I pulled the bell impatiently. There was some delay in
    answering, and I rang again.</p>
<p>Then I heard the rattle of the chain and Parker, his impassivity of
    countenance quite unmoved, stood in the open doorway.</p>
<p>I pushed past him into the hall.</p>
<p>“Where is he?” I demanded sharply.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?”</p>
<p>“Your master. Mr. Ackroyd. Don’t stand there staring at me, man. Have
    you notified the police?”</p>
<p>“The police, sir? Did you say the police?” Parker stared at me as
    though I were a ghost.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you, Parker? If, as you say, your master has
    been murdered——”</p>
<p>A gasp broke from Parker.</p>
<p>“The master? Murdered? Impossible, sir!”</p>
<p>It was my turn to stare.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you telephone to me, not five minutes ago, and tell me that Mr.
    Ackroyd had been found murdered?”</p>
<p>“Me, sir? Oh! no indeed, sir. I wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say it’s all a hoax? That there’s nothing the matter
    with Mr. Ackroyd?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir, did the person telephoning use my name?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you the exact words I heard. ‘<em>Is that Dr. Sheppard?
    Parker, the butler at Fernly, speaking. Will you please come at once,
    sir. Mr. Ackroyd has been murdered.</em>’”</p>
<p>Parker and I stared at each other blankly.</p>
<p>“A very wicked joke to play, sir,” he said at last, in a shocked tone.
    “Fancy saying a thing like that.”</p>
<p>“Where is Mr. Ackroyd?” I asked suddenly.</p>
<p>“Still in the study, I fancy, sir. The ladies have gone to bed, and
    Major Blunt and Mr. Raymond are in the billiard room.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll just look in and see him for a minute,” I said. “I know
    he didn’t want to be disturbed again, but this odd practical joke has
    made me uneasy. I’d just like to satisfy myself that he’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Quite so, sir. It makes me feel quite uneasy myself. If you don’t
    object to my accompanying you as far as the door, sir——?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said. “Come along.”</p>
<p>I passed through the door on the right, Parker on my heels, traversed
    the little lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to
    Ackroyd’s bedroom, and tapped on the study door.</p>
<p>There was no answer. I turned the handle, but the door was locked.</p>
<p>“Allow me, sir,” said Parker.</p>
<p>Very nimbly, for a man of his build, he dropped on one knee and applied
    his eye to the keyhole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>
<p>“Key is in the lock all right, sir,” he said, rising. “On the inside.
    Mr. Ackroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off
    to sleep.”</p>
<p>I bent down and verified Parker’s statement.</p>
<p>“It seems all right,” I said, “but, all the same, Parker, I’m going
    to wake your master up. I shouldn’t be satisfied to go home without
    hearing from his own lips that he’s quite all right.”</p>
<p>So saying, I rattled the handle and called out, “Ackroyd, Ackroyd, just
    a minute.”</p>
<p>But still there was no answer. I glanced over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to alarm the household,” I said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Parker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which we
    had come.</p>
<p>“I think that will be all right now, sir. The billiard room is at
    the other side of the house, and so are the kitchen quarters and the
    ladies’ bedrooms.”</p>
<p>I nodded comprehendingly. Then I banged once more frantically on the
    door, and stooping down, fairly bawled through the keyhole:—</p>
<p>“Ackroyd, Ackroyd! It’s Sheppard. Let me in.”</p>
<p>And still—silence. Not a sign of life from within the locked room.
    Parker and I glanced at each other.</p>
<p>“Look here, Parker,” I said, “I’m going to break this door in—or
    rather, we are. I’ll take the responsibility.”</p>
<p>“If you say so, sir,” said Parker, rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>“I do say so. I’m seriously alarmed about Mr. Ackroyd.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>
<p>I looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair. Parker
    and I held it between us and advanced to the assault. Once, twice, and
    three times we hurled it against the lock. At the third blow it gave,
    and we staggered into the room.</p>
<p>Ackroyd was sitting as I had left him in the arm-chair before the fire.
    His head had fallen sideways, and clearly visible, just below the
    collar of his coat, was a shining piece of twisted metalwork.</p>
<p>Parker and I advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure. I heard
    the butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss.</p>
<p>“Stabbed from be’ind,” he murmured. “’Orrible!”</p>
<p>He wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief, then stretched out a
    hand gingerly towards the hilt of the dagger.</p>
<p>“You mustn’t touch that,” I said sharply. “Go at once to the telephone
    and ring up the police station. Inform them of what has happened. Then
    tell Mr. Raymond and Major Blunt.”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>
<p>Parker hurried away, still wiping his perspiring brow.</p>
<p>I did what little had to be done. I was careful not to disturb the
    position of the body, and not to handle the dagger at all. No object
    was to be attained by moving it. Ackroyd had clearly been dead some
    little time.</p>
<p>Then I heard young Raymond’s voice, horror-stricken and incredulous,
    outside.</p>
<p>“What do you say? Oh! impossible! Where’s the doctor?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>
<p>He appeared impetuously in the doorway, then stopped dead, his face
    very white. A hand put him aside, and Hector Blunt came past him into
    the room.</p>
<p>“My God!” said Raymond from behind him; “it’s true, then.”</p>
<p>Blunt came straight on till he reached the chair. He bent over the
    body, and I thought that, like Parker, he was going to lay hold of the
    dagger hilt. I drew him back with one hand.</p>
<p>“Nothing must be moved,” I explained. “The police must see him exactly
    as he is now.”</p>
<p>Blunt nodded in instant comprehension. His face was expressionless as
    ever, but I thought I detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid
    mask. Geoffrey Raymond had joined us now, and stood peering over
    Blunt’s shoulder at the body.</p>
<p>“This is terrible,” he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>He had regained his composure, but as he took off the pince-nez he
    habitually wore and polished them I observed that his hand was shaking.</p>
<p>“Robbery, I suppose,” he said. “How did the fellow get in? Through the
    window? Has anything been taken?”</p>
<p>He went towards the desk.</p>
<p>“You think it’s burglary?” I said slowly.</p>
<p>“What else could it be? There’s no question of suicide, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“No man could stab himself in such a way,” I said confidently. “It’s
    murder right enough. But with what motive?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>
<p>“Roger hadn’t an enemy in the world,” said Blunt quietly. “Must have
    been burglars. But what was the thief after? Nothing seems to be
    disarranged?”</p>
<p>He looked round the room. Raymond was still sorting the papers on the
    desk.</p>
<p>“There seems nothing missing, and none of the drawers show signs of
    having been tampered with,” the secretary observed at last. “It’s very
    mysterious.”</p>
<p>Blunt made a slight motion with his head.</p>
<p>“There are some letters on the floor here,” he said.</p>
<p>I looked down. Three or four letters still lay where Ackroyd had
    dropped them earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>But the blue envelope containing Mrs. Ferrars’s letter had disappeared.
    I half opened my mouth to speak, but at that moment the sound of a bell
    pealed through the house. There was a confused murmur of voices in the
    hall, and then Parker appeared with our local inspector and a police
    constable.</p>
<p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” said the inspector. “I’m terribly sorry for
    this! A good kind gentleman like Mr. Ackroyd. The butler says it is
    murder. No possibility of accident or suicide, doctor?”</p>
<p>“None whatever,” I said.</p>
<p>“Ah! A bad business.”</p>
<p>He came and stood over the body.</p>
<p>“Been moved at all?” he asked sharply.</p>
<p>“Beyond making certain that life was extinct—an easy matter—I have not
    disturbed the body in any way.”</p>
<p>“Ah! And everything points to the murderer having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span> got clear away—for
    the moment, that is. Now then, let me hear all about it. Who found the
    body?”</p>
<p>I explained the circumstances carefully.</p>
<p>“A telephone message, you say? From the butler?”</p>
<p>“A message that I never sent,” declared Parker earnestly. “I’ve not
    been near the telephone the whole evening. The others can bear me out
    that I haven’t.”</p>
<p>“Very odd, that. Did it sound like Parker’s voice, doctor?”</p>
<p>“Well—I can’t say I noticed. I took it for granted, you see.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. Well, you got up here, broke in the door, and found poor
    Mr. Ackroyd like this. How long should you say he had been dead,
    doctor?”</p>
<p>“Half an hour at least—perhaps longer,” I said.</p>
<p>“The door was locked on the inside, you say? What about the window?”</p>
<p>“I myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at Mr. Ackroyd’s
    request.”</p>
<p>The inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s open now anyway,” he remarked.</p>
<p>True enough, the window was open, the lower sash being raised to its
    fullest extent.</p>
<p>The inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill
    outside.</p>
<p>“This is the way he went all right,” he remarked, “<em>and</em> got in.
    See here.”</p>
<p>In the light of the powerful torch, several clearly defined footmarks
    could be seen. They seemed to be those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> of shoes with rubber studs
    in the soles. One particularly clear one pointed inwards, another,
    slightly overlapping it, pointed outwards.</p>
<p>“Plain as a pikestaff,” said the inspector. “Any valuables missing?”</p>
<p>Geoffrey Raymond shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not so that we can discover. Mr. Ackroyd never kept anything of
    particular value in this room.”</p>
<p>“H’m,” said the inspector. “Man found an open window. Climbed in,
    saw Mr. Ackroyd sitting there—maybe he’d fallen asleep. Man stabbed
    him from behind, then lost his nerve and made off. But he’s left his
    tracks pretty clearly. We ought to get hold of <em>him</em> without much
    difficulty. No suspicious strangers been hanging about anywhere?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” I said suddenly.</p>
<p>“What is it, doctor?”</p>
<p>“I met a man this evening—just as I was turning out of the gate. He
    asked me the way to Fernly Park.”</p>
<p>“What time would that be?”</p>
<p>“Just nine o’clock. I heard it chime the hour as I was turning out of
    the gate.”</p>
<p>“Can you describe him?”</p>
<p>I did so to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>The inspector turned to the butler.</p>
<p>“Any one answering that description come to the front door?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. No one has been to the house at all this evening.”</p>
<p>“What about the back?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>
<p>“I don’t think so, sir, but I’ll make inquiries.”</p>
<p>He moved towards the door, but the inspector held up a large hand.</p>
<p>“No, thanks. I’ll do my own inquiring. But first of all I want to fix
    the time a little more clearly. When was Mr. Ackroyd last seen alive?”</p>
<p>“Probably by me,” I said, “when I left at—let me see—about ten minutes
    to nine. He told me that he didn’t wish to be disturbed, and I repeated
    the order to Parker.”</p>
<p>“Just so, sir,” said Parker respectfully.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd was certainly alive at half-past nine,” put in Raymond,
    “for I heard his voice in here talking.”</p>
<p>“Who was he talking to?”</p>
<p>“That I don’t know. Of course, at the time I took it for granted that
    it was Dr. Sheppard who was with him. I wanted to ask him a question
    about some papers I was engaged upon, but when I heard the voices I
    remembered that he had said he wanted to talk to Dr. Sheppard without
    being disturbed, and I went away again. But now it seems that the
    doctor had already left?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I was at home by a quarter-past nine,” I said. “I didn’t go out again
    until I received the telephone call.”</p>
<p>“Who could have been with him at half-past nine?” queried the
    inspector. “It wasn’t you, Mr.—er——”</p>
<p>“Major Blunt,” I said.</p>
<p>“Major Hector Blunt?” asked the inspector, a respectful tone creeping
    into his voice.</p>
<p>Blunt merely jerked his head affirmatively.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve seen you down here before, sir,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> inspector.
    “I didn’t recognize you for the moment, but you were staying with Mr.
    Ackroyd a year ago last May.”</p>
<p>“June,” corrected Blunt.</p>
<p>“Just so, June it was. Now, as I was saying, it wasn’t you with Mr.
    Ackroyd at nine-thirty this evening?”</p>
<p>Blunt shook his head.</p>
<p>“Never saw him after dinner,” he volunteered.</p>
<p>The inspector turned once more to Raymond.</p>
<p>“You didn’t overhear any of the conversation going on, did you, sir?”</p>
<p>“I did catch just a fragment of it,” said the secretary, “and,
    supposing as I did that it was Dr. Sheppard who was with Mr. Ackroyd,
    that fragment struck me as distinctly odd. As far as I can remember,
    the exact words were these. Mr. Ackroyd was speaking. ‘The calls
    on my purse have been so frequent of late’—that is what he was
    saying—‘of late, that I fear it is impossible for me to accede to your
    request....’ I went away again at once, of course, so did not hear any
    more. But I rather wondered because Dr. Sheppard——”</p>
<p>“——Does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others,” I
    finished.</p>
<p>“A demand for money,” said the inspector musingly. “It may be that here
    we have a very important clew.” He turned to the butler. “You say,
    Parker, that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I say, sir.”</p>
<p>“Then it seems almost certain that Mr. Ackroyd himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> must have
    admitted this stranger. But I don’t quite see——”</p>
<p>The inspector went into a kind of day-dream for some minutes.</p>
<p>“One thing’s clear,” he said at length, rousing himself from his
    absorption. “Mr. Ackroyd was alive and well at nine-thirty. That is the
    last moment at which he is known to have been alive.”</p>
<p>Parker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector’s
    eyes on him at once.</p>
<p>“Well?” he said sharply.</p>
<p>“If you’ll excuse me, sir, Miss Flora saw him after that.”</p>
<p>“Miss Flora?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. About a quarter to ten that would be. It was after that that
    she told me Mr. Ackroyd wasn’t to be disturbed again to-night.”</p>
<p>“Did he send her to you with that message?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly, sir. I was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when Miss
    Flora, who was just coming out of this room, stopped me and said her
    uncle didn’t want to be disturbed.”</p>
<p>The inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he
    had bestowed on him up to now.</p>
<p>“You’d already been told that Mr. Ackroyd didn’t want to be disturbed,
    hadn’t you?”</p>
<p>Parker began to stammer. His hands shook.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Quite so, sir.”</p>
<p>“And yet you were proposing to do so?”</p>
<p>“I’d forgotten, sir. At least I mean, I always bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> the whisky and
    soda about that time, sir, and ask if there’s anything more, and I
    thought—well, I was doing as usual without thinking.”</p>
<p>It was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that Parker was
    most suspiciously flustered. The man was shaking and twitching all over.</p>
<p>“H’m,” said the inspector. “I must see Miss Ackroyd at once. For the
    moment we’ll leave this room exactly as it is. I can return here after
    I’ve heard what Miss Ackroyd has to tell me. I shall just take the
    precaution of shutting and bolting the window.”</p>
<p>This precaution accomplished, he led the way into the hall and we
    followed him. He paused a moment, as he glanced up at the little
    staircase, then spoke over his shoulder to the constable.</p>
<p>“Jones, you’d better stay here. Don’t let any one go into that room.”</p>
<p>Parker interposed deferentially.</p>
<p>“If you’ll excuse me, sir. If you were to lock the door into the main
    hall, nobody could gain access to this part. That staircase leads only
    to Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom and bathroom. There is no communication with
    the other part of the house. There once was a door through, but Mr.
    Ackroyd had it blocked up. He liked to feel that his suite was entirely
    private.”</p>
<p>To make things clear and explain the position, I have appended a rough
    sketch of the right-hand wing of the house. The small staircase leads,
    as Parker explained, to a big bedroom (made by two being knocked into
    one) and an adjoining bathroom and lavatory.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp66">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>
<p>The inspector took in the position at a glance. We went through into
    the large hall and he locked the door behind him, slipping the key into
    his pocket. Then he gave the constable some low-voiced instructions,
    and the latter prepared to depart.</p>
<p>“We must get busy on those shoe tracks,” explained the inspector. “But
    first of all, I must have a word with Miss Ackroyd. She was the last
    person to see her uncle alive. Does she know yet?”</p>
<p>Raymond shook his head.</p>
<p>“Well, no need to tell her for another five minutes. She can answer my
    questions better without being upset by knowing the truth about her
    uncle. Tell her there’s been a burglary, and ask her if she would mind
    dressing and coming down to answer a few questions.”</p>
<p>It was Raymond who went upstairs on this errand.</p>
<p>“Miss Ackroyd will be down in a minute,” he said, when he returned. “I
    told her just what you suggested.”</p>
<p>In less than five minutes Flora descended the staircase. She was
    wrapped in a pale pink silk kimono. She looked anxious and excited.</p>
<p>The inspector stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, Miss Ackroyd,” he said civilly. “We’re afraid there’s
    been an attempt at robbery, and we want you to help us. What’s this
    room—the billiard room? Come in here and sit down.”</p>
<p>Flora sat down composedly on the wide divan which ran the length of the
    wall, and looked up at the inspector.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite understand. What has been stolen? What do you want me to
    tell you?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>
<p>“It’s just this, Miss Ackroyd. Parker here says you came out of your
    uncle’s study at about a quarter to ten. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Quite right. I had been to say good-night to him.”</p>
<p>“And the time is correct?”</p>
<p>“Well, it must have been about then. I can’t say exactly. It might have
    been later.”</p>
<p>“Was your uncle alone, or was there any one with him?”</p>
<p>“He was alone. Dr. Sheppard had gone.”</p>
<p>“Did you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut?”</p>
<p>Flora shook her head.</p>
<p>“I can’t say. The curtains were drawn.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. And your uncle seemed quite as usual?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>“Do you mind telling us exactly what passed between you?”</p>
<p>Flora paused a minute, as though to collect her recollections.</p>
<p>“I went in and said, ‘Good-night, uncle, I’m going to bed now. I’m
    tired to-night.’ He gave a sort of grunt, and—I went over and kissed
    him, and he said something about my looking nice in the frock I had on,
    and then he told me to run away as he was busy. So I went.”</p>
<p>“Did he ask specially not to be disturbed?”</p>
<p>“Oh! yes, I forgot. He said: ‘Tell Parker I don’t want anything more
    to-night, and that he’s not to disturb me.’ I met Parker just outside
    the door and gave him uncle’s message.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>
<p>“Just so,” said the inspector.</p>
<p>“Won’t you tell me what it is that has been stolen?”</p>
<p>“We’re not quite—certain,” said the inspector hesitatingly.</p>
<p>A wide look of alarm came into the girl’s eyes. She started up.</p>
<p>“What is it? You’re hiding something from me?”</p>
<p>Moving in his usual unobtrusive manner, Hector Blunt came between her
    and the inspector. She half stretched out her hand, and he took it in
    both of his, patting it as though she were a very small child, and she
    turned to him as though something in his stolid, rocklike demeanor
    promised comfort and safety.</p>
<p>“It’s bad news, Flora,” he said quietly. “Bad news for all of us. Your
    Uncle Roger——”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It will be a shock to you. Bound to be. Poor Roger’s dead.”</p>
<p>Flora drew away from him, her eyes dilating with horror.</p>
<p>“When?” she whispered. “When?”</p>
<p>“Very soon after you left him, I’m afraid,” said Blunt gravely.</p>
<p>Flora raised her hand to her throat, gave a little cry, and I hurried
    to catch her as she fell. She had fainted, and Blunt and I carried her
    upstairs and laid her on her bed. Then I got him to wake Mrs. Ackroyd
    and tell her the news. Flora soon revived, and I brought her mother to
    her, telling her what to do for the girl. Then I hurried downstairs again.</p>

<div class="subhead">THE TUNISIAN DAGGER</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I met</span> the inspector just coming from the door which led into the
    kitchen quarters.</p>
<p>“How’s the young lady, doctor?”</p>
<p>“Coming round nicely. Her mother’s with her.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. I’ve been questioning the servants. They all declare that
    no one has been to the back door to-night. Your description of that
    stranger was rather vague. Can’t you give us something more definite to
    go upon?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not,” I said regretfully. “It was a dark night, you see,
    and the fellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed
    down over his eyes.”</p>
<p>“H’m,” said the inspector. “Looked as though he wanted to conceal his
    face. Sure it was no one you know?”</p>
<p>I replied in the negative, but not as decidedly as I might have done. I
    remembered my impression that the stranger’s voice was not unfamiliar
    to me. I explained this rather haltingly to the inspector.</p>
<p>“It was a rough, uneducated voice, you say?”</p>
<p>I agreed, but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an
    almost exaggerated quality. If, as the inspector thought, the man had
    wished to hide his face, he might equally well have tried to disguise
    his voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>
<p>“Do you mind coming into the study with me again, doctor? There are one
    or two things I want to ask you.”</p>
<p>I acquiesced. Inspector Davis unlocked the door of the lobby, we passed
    through, and he locked the door again behind him.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be disturbed,” he said grimly. “And we don’t want any
    eavesdropping either. What’s all this about blackmail?”</p>
<p>“Blackmail!” I exclaimed, very much startled.</p>
<p>“Is it an effort of Parker’s imagination? Or is there something in it?”</p>
<p>“If Parker heard anything about blackmail,” I said slowly, “he must
    have been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the
    keyhole.”</p>
<p>Davis nodded.</p>
<p>“Nothing more likely. You see, I’ve been instituting a few inquiries as
    to what Parker has been doing with himself this evening. To tell the
    truth, I didn’t like his manner. The man knows something. When I began
    to question him, he got the wind up, and plumped out some garbled story
    of blackmail.”</p>
<p>I took an instant decision.</p>
<p>“I’m rather glad you’ve brought the matter up,” I said. “I’ve been
    trying to decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not. I’d
    already practically decided to tell you everything, but I was going to
    wait for a favorable opportunity. You might as well have it now.”</p>
<p>And then and there I narrated the whole events of the evening as I
    have set them down here. The inspector listened keenly, occasionally
    interjecting a question.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>
<p>“Most extraordinary story I ever heard,” he said, when I had finished.
    “And you say that letter has completely disappeared? It looks bad—it
    looks very bad indeed. It gives us what we’ve been looking for—a motive
    for the murder.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I realize that.”</p>
<p>“You say that Mr. Ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some member
    of his household was involved? Household’s rather an elastic term.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think that Parker himself might be the man we’re after?” I
    suggested.</p>
<p>“It looks very like it. He was obviously listening at the door when
    you came out. Then Miss Ackroyd came across him later bent on entering
    the study. Say he tried again when she was safely out of the way. He
    stabbed Ackroyd, locked the door on the inside, opened the window, and
    got out that way, and went round to a side door which he had previously
    left open. How’s that?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one thing against it,” I said slowly. “If Ackroyd went on
    reading that letter as soon as I left, as he intended to do, I don’t
    see him continuing to sit on here and turn things over in his mind for
    another hour. He’d have had Parker in at once, accused him then and
    there, and there would have been a fine old uproar. Remember, Ackroyd
    was a man of choleric temper.”</p>
<p>“Mightn’t have had time to go on with the letter just then,” suggested
    the inspector. “We know some one was with him at half-past nine. If
    that visitor turned up as soon as you left, and after he went, Miss
    Ackroyd came in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> to say good-night—well, he wouldn’t be able to go on
    with the letter until close upon ten o’clock.”</p>
<p>“And the telephone call?”</p>
<p>“Parker sent that all right—perhaps before he thought of the locked
    door and open window. Then he changed his mind—or got in a panic—and
    decided to deny all knowledge of it. That was it, depend upon it.”</p>
<p>“Ye-es,” I said rather doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Anyway, we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the
    exchange. If it was put through from here, I don’t see how any one
    else but Parker could have sent it. Depend upon it, he’s our man.
    But keep it dark—we don’t want to alarm him just yet, till we’ve got
    all the evidence. I’ll see to it he doesn’t give us the slip. To all
    appearances we’ll be concentrating on your mysterious stranger.”</p>
<p>He rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to
    the desk, and crossed over to the still form in the arm-chair.</p>
<p>“The weapon ought to give us a clew,” he remarked, looking up. “It’s
    something quite unique—a curio, I should think, by the look of it.”</p>
<p>He bent down, surveying the handle attentively, and I heard him give a
    grunt of satisfaction. Then, very gingerly, he pressed his hands down
    below the hilt and drew the blade out from the wound. Still carrying it
    so as not to touch the handle, he placed it in a wide china mug which
    adorned the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, nodding at it. “Quite a work of art. There can’t be
    many of them about.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>
<p>It was indeed a beautiful object. A narrow, tapering blade, and a hilt
    of elaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship.
    He touched the blade gingerly with his finger, testing its sharpness,
    and made an appreciative grimace.</p>
<p>“Lord, what an edge,” he exclaimed. “A child could drive that into a
    man—as easy as cutting butter. A dangerous sort of toy to have about.”</p>
<p>“May I examine the body properly now?” I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>I made a thorough examination.</p>
<p>“Well?” said the inspector, when I had finished.</p>
<p>“I’ll spare you the technical language,” I said. “We’ll keep that
    for the inquest. The blow was delivered by a right-handed man
    standing behind him, and death must have been instantaneous. By the
    expression on the dead man’s face, I should say that the blow was quite
    unexpected. He probably died without knowing who his assailant was.”</p>
<p>“Butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats,” said Inspector Davis.
    “There’s not going to be much mystery about this crime. Take a look at
    the hilt of that dagger.”</p>
<p>I took the look.</p>
<p>“I dare say they’re not apparent to you, but I can see them clearly
    enough.” He lowered his voice. “<em>Fingerprints!</em>”</p>
<p>He stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said mildly. “I guessed that.”</p>
<p>I do not see why I should be supposed to be totally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> devoid of
    intelligence. After all, I read detective stories, and the newspapers,
    and am a man of quite average ability. If there had been toe marks on
    the dagger handle, now, that would have been quite a different thing. I
    would then have registered any amount of surprise and awe.</p>
<p>I think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get
    thrilled. He picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to
    the billiard room.</p>
<p>“I want to see if Mr. Raymond can tell us anything about this dagger,”
    he explained.</p>
<p>Locking the outer door behind us again, we made our way to the billiard
    room, where we found Geoffrey Raymond. The inspector held up his
    exhibit.</p>
<p>“Ever seen this before, Mr. Raymond?”</p>
<p>“Why—I believe—I’m almost sure that is a curio given to Mr. Ackroyd
    by Major Blunt. It comes from Morocco—no, Tunis. So the crime was
    committed with that? What an extraordinary thing. It seems almost
    impossible, and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same. May I
    fetch Major Blunt?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, he hurried off.</p>
<p>“Nice young fellow that,” said the inspector. “Something honest and
    ingenuous about him.”</p>
<p>I agreed. In the two years that Geoffrey Raymond has been secretary to
    Ackroyd, I have never seen him ruffled or out of temper. And he has
    been, I know, a most efficient secretary.</p>
<p>In a minute or two Raymond returned, accompanied by Blunt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>
<p>“I was right,” said Raymond excitedly. “It <em>is</em> the Tunisian
    dagger.”</p>
<p>“Major Blunt hasn’t looked at it yet,” objected the inspector.</p>
<p>“Saw it the moment I came into the study,” said the quiet man.</p>
<p>“You recognized it then?”</p>
<p>Blunt nodded.</p>
<p>“You said nothing about it,” said the inspector suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Wrong moment,” said Blunt. “Lot of harm done by blurting out things at
    the wrong time.”</p>
<p>He returned the inspector’s stare placidly enough.</p>
<p>The latter grunted at last and turned away. He brought the dagger over
    to Blunt.</p>
<p>“You’re quite sure about it, sir. You identify it positively?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. No doubt whatever.”</p>
<p>“Where was this—er—curio usually kept? Can you tell me that, sir?”</p>
<p>It was the secretary who answered.</p>
<p>“In the silver table in the drawing-room.”</p>
<p>“What?” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>The others looked at me.</p>
<p>“Yes, doctor?” said the inspector encouragingly.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Yes, doctor?” said the inspector again, still more encouragingly.</p>
<p>“It’s so trivial,” I explained apologetically. “Only that when I
    arrived last night for dinner I heard the lid of the silver table being
    shut down in the drawing-room.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>
<p>I saw profound skepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector’s
    countenance.</p>
<p>“How did you know it was the silver table lid?”</p>
<p>I was forced to explain in detail—a long, tedious explanation which I
    would infinitely rather not have had to make.</p>
<p>The inspector heard me to the end.</p>
<p>“Was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents?”
    he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “I can’t say I remember noticing it—but, of
    course, it may have been there all the time.”</p>
<p>“We’d better get hold of the housekeeper,” remarked the inspector, and
    pulled the bell.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Miss Russell, summoned by Parker, entered the room.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I went near the silver table,” she said, when the
    inspector had posed his question. “I was looking to see that all the
    flowers were fresh. Oh! yes, I remember now. The silver table was
    open—which it had no business to be, and I shut the lid down as I
    passed.”</p>
<p>She looked at him aggressively.</p>
<p>“I see,” said the inspector. “Can you tell me if this dagger was in its
    place then?”</p>
<p>Miss Russell looked at the weapon composedly.</p>
<p>“I can’t say, I’m sure,” she replied. “I didn’t stop to look. I knew
    the family would be down any minute, and I wanted to get away.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said the inspector.</p>
<p>There was just a trace of hesitation in his manner, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> though he would
    have liked to question her further, but Miss Russell clearly accepted
    the words as a dismissal, and glided from the room.</p>
<p>“Rather a Tartar, I should fancy, eh?” said the inspector, looking
    after her. “Let me see. This silver table is in front of one of the
    windows, I think you said, doctor?”</p>
<p>Raymond answered for me.</p>
<p>“Yes, the left-hand window.”</p>
<p>“And the window was open?”</p>
<p>“They were both ajar.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think we need go into the question much further.
    Somebody—I’ll just say somebody—could get that dagger any time he
    liked, and exactly when he got it doesn’t matter in the least. I’ll be
    coming up in the morning with the chief constable, Mr. Raymond. Until
    then, I’ll keep the key of that door. I want Colonel Melrose to see
    everything exactly as it is. I happen to know that he’s dining out the
    other side of the county, and, I believe, staying the night....”</p>
<p>We watched the inspector take up the jar.</p>
<p>“I shall have to pack this carefully,” he observed. “It’s going to be
    an important piece of evidence in more ways than one.”</p>
<p>A few minutes later as I came out of the billiard room with Raymond,
    the latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.</p>
<p>I felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and followed the direction
    of his eyes. Inspector Davis seemed to be inviting Parker’s opinion of
    a small pocket diary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>
<p>“A little obvious,” murmured my companion. “So Parker is the suspect,
    is he? Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints
    also?”</p>
<p>He took two cards from the card tray, wiped them with his silk
    handkerchief, then handed one to me and took the other himself. Then,
    with a grin, he handed them to the police inspector.</p>
<p>“Souvenirs,” he said. “<abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 1, Dr. Sheppard; <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2, my humble self. One
    from Major Blunt will be forthcoming in the morning.”</p>
<p>Youth is very buoyant. Even the brutal murder of his friend and
    employer could not dim Geoffrey Raymond’s spirits for long. Perhaps
    that is as it should be. I do not know. I have lost the quality of
    resilience long since myself.</p>
<p>It was very late when I got back, and I hoped that Caroline would have
    gone to bed. I might have known better.</p>
<p>She had hot cocoa waiting for me, and whilst I drank it, she extracted
    the whole history of the evening from me. I said nothing of the
    blackmailing business, but contented myself with giving her the facts
    of the murder.</p>
<p>“The police suspect Parker,” I said, as I rose to my feet and prepared
    to ascend to bed. “There seems a fairly clear case against him.”</p>
<p>“Parker!” said my sister. “Fiddlesticks! That inspector must be a
    perfect fool. Parker indeed! Don’t tell me.”</p>
<p>With which obscure pronouncement we went up to bed.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">I LEARN MY NEIGHBOR’S PROFESSION</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning I hurried unforgivably over my round. My
    excuse can be that I had no very serious cases to attend. On my return
    Caroline came into the hall to greet me.</p>
<p>“Flora Ackroyd is here,” she announced in an excited whisper.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I concealed my surprise as best I could.</p>
<p>“She’s very anxious to see you. She’s been here half an hour.”</p>
<p>Caroline led the way into our small sitting-room, and I followed.</p>
<p>Flora was sitting on the sofa by the window. She was in black and she
    sat nervously twisting her hands together. I was shocked by the sight
    of her face. All the color had faded away from it. But when she spoke
    her manner was as composed and resolute as possible.</p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard, I have come to ask you to help me.”</p>
<p>“Of course he’ll help you, my dear,” said Caroline.</p>
<p>I don’t think Flora really wished Caroline to be present at the
    interview. She would, I am sure, have infinitely preferred to speak to
    me privately. But she also wanted to waste no time, so she made the
    best of it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>
<p>“I want you to come to The Larches with me.”</p>
<p>“The Larches?” I queried, surprised.</p>
<p>“To see that funny little man?” exclaimed Caroline.</p>
<p>“Yes. You know who he is, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“We fancied,” I said, “that he might be a retired hairdresser.”</p>
<p>Flora’s blue eyes opened very wide.</p>
<p>“Why, he’s Hercule Poirot! You know who I mean—the private detective.
    They say he’s done the most wonderful things—just like detectives do in
    books. A year ago he retired and came to live down here. Uncle knew who
    he was, but he promised not to tell any one, because M. Poirot wanted
    to live quietly without being bothered by people.”</p>
<p>“So that’s who he is,” I said slowly.</p>
<p>“You’ve heard of him, of course?”</p>
<p>“I’m rather an old fogey, as Caroline tells me,” I said, “but I
    <em>have</em> just heard of him.”</p>
<p>“Extraordinary!” commented Caroline.</p>
<p>I don’t know what she was referring to—possibly her own failure to
    discover the truth.</p>
<p>“You want to go and see him?” I asked slowly. “Now why?”</p>
<p>“To get him to investigate this murder, of course,” said Caroline
    sharply. “Don’t be so stupid, James.”</p>
<p>I was not really being stupid. Caroline does not always understand what
    I am driving at.</p>
<p>“You haven’t got confidence in Inspector Davis?” I went on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>
<p>“Of course she hasn’t,” said Caroline. “I haven’t either.”</p>
<p>Any one would have thought it was Caroline’s uncle who had been
    murdered.</p>
<p>“And how do you know he would take up the case?” I asked. “Remember he
    has retired from active work.”</p>
<p>“That’s just it,” said Flora simply. “I’ve got to persuade him.”</p>
<p>“You are sure you are doing wisely?” I asked gravely.</p>
<p>“Of course she is,” said Caroline. “I’ll go with her myself if she
    likes.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather the doctor came with me if you don’t mind, Miss Sheppard,”
    said Flora.</p>
<p>She knows the value of being direct on certain occasions. Any hints
    would certainly have been wasted on Caroline.</p>
<p>“You see,” she explained, following directness with tact, “Dr. Sheppard
    being the doctor, and having found the body, he would be able to give
    all the details to M. Poirot.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Caroline grudgingly, “I see that.”</p>
<p>I took a turn or two up and down the room.</p>
<p>“Flora,” I said gravely, “be guided by me. I advise you not to drag
    this detective into the case.”</p>
<p>Flora sprang to her feet. The color rushed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>“I know why you say that,” she cried. “But it’s exactly for that reason
    I’m so anxious to go. You’re afraid! But I’m not. I know Ralph better
    than you do.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>
<p>“Ralph,” said Caroline. “What has Ralph got to do with it?”</p>
<p>Neither of us heeded her.</p>
<p>“Ralph may be weak,” continued Flora. “He may have done foolish things
    in the past—wicked things even—but he wouldn’t murder any one.”</p>
<p>“No, no,” I exclaimed. “I never thought it of him.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you go to the Three Boars last night?” demanded Flora,
    “on your way home—after uncle’s body was found?”</p>
<p>I was momentarily silenced. I had hoped that that visit of mine would
    remain unnoticed.</p>
<p>“How did you know about that?” I countered.</p>
<p>“I went there this morning,” said Flora. “I heard from the servants
    that Ralph was staying there——”</p>
<p>I interrupted her.</p>
<p>“You had no idea that he was in King’s Abbot?”</p>
<p>“No. I was astounded. I couldn’t understand it. I went there and asked
    for him. They told me, what I suppose they told you last night, that
    he went out at about nine o’clock yesterday evening—and—and never came
    back.”</p>
<p>Her eyes met mine defiantly, and as though answering something in my
    look, she burst out:—</p>
<p>“Well, why shouldn’t he? He might have gone—anywhere. He may even have
    gone back to London.”</p>
<p>“Leaving his luggage behind?” I asked gently.</p>
<p>Flora stamped her foot.</p>
<p>“I don’t care. There must be a simple explanation.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you want to go to Hercule Poirot?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> Isn’t it better to
    leave things as they are? The police don’t suspect Ralph in the least,
    remember. They’re working on quite another tack.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just <em>it</em>,” cried the girl. “They <em>do</em> suspect
    him. A man from Cranchester turned up this morning—Inspector Raglan,
    a horrid, weaselly little man. I found he had been to the Three Boars
    this morning before me. They told me all about his having been there,
    and the questions he had asked. He must think Ralph did it.”</p>
<p>“That’s a change of mind from last night, if so,” I said slowly. “He
    doesn’t believe in Davis’s theory that it was Parker then?”</p>
<p>“Parker indeed,” said my sister, and snorted.</p>
<p>Flora came forward and laid her hand on my arm.</p>
<p>“Oh! Dr. Sheppard, let us go at once to this M. Poirot. He will find
    out the truth.”</p>
<p>“My dear Flora,” I said gently, laying my hand on hers. “Are you quite
    sure it is the truth we want?”</p>
<p>She looked at me, nodding her head gravely.</p>
<p>“You’re not sure,” she said. “I am. I know Ralph better than you do.”</p>
<p>“Of course he didn’t do it,” said Caroline, who had been keeping silent
    with great difficulty. “Ralph may be extravagant, but he’s a dear boy,
    and has the nicest manners.”</p>
<p>I wanted to tell Caroline that large numbers of murderers have had
    nice manners, but the presence of Flora restrained me. Since the
    girl was determined, I was forced to give in to her and we started
    at once, getting away before my sister was able to fire off any more
    pronouncements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> beginning with her favorite words, “Of course.”</p>
<p>An old woman with an immense Breton cap opened the door of The Larches
    to us. M. Poirot was at home, it seemed.</p>
<p>We were ushered into a little sitting-room arranged with formal
    precision, and there, after the lapse of a minute or so, my friend of
    yesterday came to us.</p>
<p>“Monsieur le docteur,” he said, smiling. “Mademoiselle.”</p>
<p>He bowed to Flora.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” I began, “you have heard of the tragedy which occurred last
    night.”</p>
<p>His face grew grave.</p>
<p>“But certainly I have heard. It is horrible. I offer mademoiselle all
    my sympathy. In what way can I serve you?”</p>
<p>“Miss Ackroyd,” I said, “wants you to—to——”</p>
<p>“To find the murderer,” said Flora in a clear voice.</p>
<p>“I see,” said the little man. “But the police will do that, will they
    not?”</p>
<p>“They might make a mistake,” said Flora. “They are on their way to make
    a mistake now, I think. Please, M. Poirot, won’t you help us? If—if it
    is a question of money——”</p>
<p>Poirot held up his hand.</p>
<p>“Not that, I beg of you, mademoiselle. Not that I do not care for
    money.” His eyes showed a momentary twinkle. “Money, it means much to
    me and always has done. No, if I go into this, you must understand one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
    thing clearly. <em>I shall go through with it to the end.</em> The good
    dog, he does not leave the scent, remember! You may wish that, after
    all, you had left it to the local police.”</p>
<p>“I want the truth,” said Flora, looking him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>“All the truth?”</p>
<p>“All the truth.”</p>
<p>“Then I accept,” said the little man quietly. “And I hope you will not
    regret those words. Now, tell me all the circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard had better tell you,” said Flora. “He knows more than I
    do.”</p>
<p>Thus enjoined, I plunged into a careful narrative, embodying all the
    facts I have previously set down. Poirot listened carefully, inserting
    a question here and there, but for the most part sitting in silence,
    his eyes on the ceiling.</p>
<p>I brought my story to a close with the departure of the inspector and
    myself from Fernly Park the previous night.</p>
<p>“And now,” said Flora, as I finished, “tell him all about Ralph.”</p>
<p>I hesitated, but her imperious glance drove me on.</p>
<p>“You went to this inn—this Three Boars—last night on your way home?”
    asked Poirot, as I brought my tale to a close. “Now exactly why was
    that?”</p>
<p>I paused a moment to choose my words carefully.</p>
<p>“I thought some one ought to inform the young man of his uncle’s death.
    It occurred to me after I had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> Fernly that possibly no one but
    myself and Mr. Ackroyd were aware that he was staying in the village.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“Quite so. That was your only motive in going there, eh?”</p>
<p>“That was my only motive,” I said stiffly.</p>
<p>“It was not to—shall we say—reassure yourself about <i lang="fr">ce jeune homme</i>?”</p>
<p>“Reassure myself?”</p>
<p>“I think, M. le docteur, that you know very well what I mean, though
    you pretend not to do so. I suggest that it would have been a relief
    to you if you had found that Captain Paton had been at home all the
    evening.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said sharply.</p>
<p>The little detective shook his head at me gravely.</p>
<p>“You have not the trust in me of Miss Flora,” he said. “But no matter.
    What we have to look at is this—Captain Paton is missing, under
    circumstances which call for an explanation. I will not hide from you
    that the matter looks grave. Still, it may admit of a perfectly simple
    explanation.”</p>
<p>“That’s just what I keep saying,” cried Flora eagerly.</p>
<p>Poirot touched no more upon that theme. Instead he suggested an
    immediate visit to the local police. He thought it better for Flora
    to return home, and for me to be the one to accompany him there and
    introduce him to the officer in charge of the case.</p>
<p>We carried out this plan forthwith. We found Inspector Davis outside
    the police station looking very glum indeed. With him was Colonel
    Melrose, the Chief Constable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> and another man whom, from Flora’s
    description of “weaselly,” I had no difficulty in recognizing as
    Inspector Raglan from Cranchester.</p>
<p>I know Melrose fairly well, and I introduced Poirot to him and
    explained the situation. The chief constable was clearly vexed, and
    Inspector Raglan looked as black as thunder. Davis, however, seemed
    slightly exhilarated by the sight of his superior officer’s annoyance.</p>
<p>“The case is going to be plain as a pikestaff,” said Raglan. “Not the
    least need for amateurs to come butting in. You’d think any fool would
    have seen the way things were last night, and then we shouldn’t have
    lost twelve hours.”</p>
<p>He directed a vengeful glance at poor Davis, who received it with
    perfect stolidity.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd’s family must, of course, do what they see fit,” said
    Colonel Melrose. “But we cannot have the official investigation
    hampered in any way. I know M. Poirot’s great reputation, of course,”
    he added courteously.</p>
<p>“The police can’t advertise themselves, worse luck,” said Raglan.</p>
<p>It was Poirot who saved the situation.</p>
<p>“It is true that I have retired from the world,” he said. “I never
    intended to take up a case again. Above all things, I have a horror of
    publicity. I must beg, that in the case of my being able to contribute
    something to the solution of the mystery, my name may not be mentioned.”</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan’s face lightened a little.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>
<p>“I’ve heard of some very remarkable successes of yours,” observed the
    colonel, thawing.</p>
<p>“I have had much experience,” said Poirot quietly. “But most of my
    successes have been obtained by the aid of the police. I admire
    enormously your English police. If Inspector Raglan permits me to
    assist him, I shall be both honored and flattered.”</p>
<p>The inspector’s countenance became still more gracious.</p>
<p>Colonel Melrose drew me aside.</p>
<p>“From all I hear, this little fellow’s done some really remarkable
    things,” he murmured. “We’re naturally anxious not to have to call in
    Scotland Yard. Raglan seems very sure of himself, but I’m not quite
    certain that I agree with him. You see, I—er—know the parties concerned
    better than he does. This fellow doesn’t seem out after kudos, does he?
    Would work in with us unobtrusively, eh?”</p>
<p>“To the greater glory of Inspector Raglan,” I said solemnly.</p>
<p>“Well, well,” said Colonel Melrose breezily in a louder voice, “we must
    put you wise to the latest developments, M. Poirot.”</p>
<p>“I thank you,” said Poirot. “My friend, Dr. Sheppard, said something of
    the butler being suspected?”</p>
<p>“That’s all bunkum,” said Raglan instantly. “These high-class servants
    get in such a funk that they act suspiciously for nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“The fingerprints?” I hinted.</p>
<p>“Nothing like Parker’s.” He gave a faint smile, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> added: “And yours
    and Mr. Raymond’s don’t fit either, doctor.”</p>
<p>“What about those of Captain Ralph Paton?” asked Poirot quietly.</p>
<p>I felt a secret admiration for the way he took the bull by the horns. I
    saw a look of respect creep into the inspector’s eye.</p>
<p>“I see you don’t let the grass grow under your feet, Mr. Poirot. It
    will be a pleasure to work with you, I’m sure. We’re going to take that
    young gentleman’s fingerprints as soon as we can lay hands upon him.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help thinking you’re mistaken, inspector,” said Colonel
    Melrose warmly. “I’ve known Ralph Paton from a boy upward. He’d never
    stoop to murder.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” said the inspector tonelessly.</p>
<p>“What have you got against him?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Went out just on nine o’clock last night. Was seen in neighborhood of
    Fernly Park somewhere about nine-thirty. Not been seen since. Believed
    to be in serious money difficulties. I’ve got a pair of his shoes
    here—shoes with rubber studs in them. He had two pairs, almost exactly
    alike. I’m going up now to compare them with those footmarks. The
    constable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them.”</p>
<p>“We’ll go at once,” said Colonel Melrose. “You and M. Poirot will
    accompany us, will you not?”</p>
<p>We assented, and all drove up in the colonel’s car. The inspector was
    anxious to get at once to the footmarks, and asked to be put down at
    the lodge. About half-way up the drive, on the right, a path branched
    off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> which led round to the terrace and the window of Ackroyd’s study.</p>
<p>“Would you like to go with the inspector, M. Poirot?” asked the chief
    constable, “or would you prefer to examine the study?”</p>
<p>Poirot chose the latter alternative. Parker opened the door to us. His
    manner was smug and deferential, and he seemed to have recovered from
    his panic of the night before.</p>
<p>Colonel Melrose took a key from his pocket, and unlocking the door
    which led into the lobby, he ushered us through into the study.</p>
<p>“Except for the removal of the body, M. Poirot, this room is exactly as
    it was last night.”</p>
<p>“And the body was found—where?”</p>
<p>As precisely as possible, I described Ackroyd’s position. The arm-chair
    still stood in front of the fire.</p>
<p>Poirot went and sat down in it.</p>
<p>“The blue letter you speak of, where was it when you left the room?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd had laid it down on this little table at his right hand.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“Except for that, everything was in its place?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Colonel Melrose, would you be so extremely obliging as to sit down in
    this chair a minute. I thank you. Now, M. le docteur, will you kindly
    indicate to me the exact position of the dagger?”</p>
<p>I did so, whilst the little man stood in the doorway.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>
<p>“The hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then. Both
    you and Parker could see it at once?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Poirot went next to the window.</p>
<p>“The electric light was on, of course, when you discovered the body?”
    he asked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I assented, and joined him where he was studying the marks on the
    window-sill.</p>
<p>“The rubber studs are the same pattern as those in Captain Paton’s
    shoes,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>Then he came back once more to the middle of the room. His eye traveled
    round, searching everything in the room with a quick, trained glance.</p>
<p>“Are you a man of good observation, Dr. Sheppard?” he asked at last.</p>
<p>“I think so,” I said, surprised.</p>
<p>“There was a fire in the grate, I see. When you broke the door down and
    found Mr. Ackroyd dead, how was the fire? Was it low?”</p>
<p>I gave a vexed laugh.</p>
<p>“I—I really can’t say. I didn’t notice. Perhaps Mr. Raymond or Major
    Blunt——”</p>
<p>The little man opposite me shook his head with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“One must always proceed with method. I made an error of judgment in
    asking you that question. To each man his own knowledge. You could tell
    me the details of the patient’s appearance—nothing there would escape
    you. If I wanted information about the papers on that desk, Mr. Raymond
    would have noticed anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> there was to see. To find out about the
    fire, I must ask the man whose business it is to observe such things.
    You permit——”</p>
<p>He moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell.</p>
<p>After a lapse of a minute or two Parker appeared.</p>
<p>“The bell rang, sir,” he said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“Come in, Parker,” said Colonel Melrose. “This gentleman wants to ask
    you something.”</p>
<p>Parker transferred a respectful attention to Poirot.</p>
<p>“Parker,” said the little man, “when you broke down the door with Dr.
    Sheppard last night, and found your master dead, what was the state of
    the fire?”</p>
<p>Parker replied without a pause.</p>
<p>“It had burned very low, sir. It was almost out.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Poirot. The exclamation sounded almost triumphant. He went
    on:—</p>
<p>“Look round you, my good Parker. Is this room exactly as it was then?”</p>
<p>The butler’s eye swept round. It came to rest on the windows.</p>
<p>“The curtains were drawn, sir, and the electric light was on.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded approval.</p>
<p>“Anything else?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, this chair was drawn out a little more.”</p>
<p>He indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it
    and the window. I append a plan of the room with the chair in question
    marked with an X.</p>
<p>“Just show me,” said Poirot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp100">
<img alt="" src="images/i089.jpg" id="id-6735956547836006417">
</div>
<p>The butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the
    wall, turning it so that the seat faced the door.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Voilà ce qui est curieux</i>,” murmured Poirot. “No one would want
    to sit in a chair in such a position, I fancy. Now who pushed it back
    into place again, I wonder? Did you, my friend?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” said Parker. “I was too upset with seeing the master and
    all.”</p>
<p>Poirot looked across at me.</p>
<p>“Did you, doctor?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“It was back in position when I arrived with the police, sir,” put in
    Parker. “I’m sure of that.”</p>
<p>“Curious,” said Poirot again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>
<p>“Raymond or Blunt must have pushed it back,” I suggested. “Surely it
    isn’t important?”</p>
<p>“It is completely unimportant,” said Poirot. “That is why it is so
    interesting,” he added softly.</p>
<p>“Excuse me a minute,” said Colonel Melrose. He left the room with
    Parker.</p>
<p>“Do you think Parker is speaking the truth?” I asked.</p>
<p>“About the chair, yes. Otherwise I do not know. You will find, M. le
    docteur, if you have much to do with cases of this kind, that they all
    resemble each other in one thing.”</p>
<p>“What is that?” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Every one concerned in them has something to hide.”</p>
<p>“Have I?” I asked, smiling.</p>
<p>Poirot looked at me attentively.</p>
<p>“I think you have,” he said quietly.</p>
<p>“But——”</p>
<p>“Have you told me everything known to you about this young man Paton?”
    He smiled as I grew red. “Oh! do not fear. I will not press you. I
    shall learn it in good time.”</p>
<p>“I wish you’d tell me something of your methods,” I said hastily, to
    cover my confusion. “The point about the fire, for instance?”</p>
<p>“Oh! that was very simple. You leave Mr. Ackroyd at—ten minutes to
    nine, was it not?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly, I should say.”</p>
<p>“The window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked. At a
    quarter past ten when the body is discovered, the door is locked and
    the window is open.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> Who opened it? Clearly only Mr. Ackroyd himself
    could have done so, and for one of two reasons. Either because the room
    became unbearably hot (but since the fire was nearly out and there was
    a sharp drop in temperature last night, that cannot be the reason),
    or because he admitted some one that way. And if he admitted some one
    that way, it must have been some one well known to him, since he had
    previously shown himself uneasy on the subject of that same window.”</p>
<p>“It sounds very simple,” I said.</p>
<p>“Everything is simple, if you arrange the facts methodically. We are
    concerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at
    nine-thirty last night. Everything goes to show that that was the
    individual admitted by the window, and though Mr. Ackroyd was seen
    alive later by Miss Flora, we cannot approach a solution of the mystery
    until we know who that visitor was. The window may have been left open
    after his departure and so afforded entrance to the murderer, or the
    same person may have returned a second time. Ah! here is the colonel
    who returns.”</p>
<p>Colonel Melrose entered with an animated manner.</p>
<p>“That telephone call has been traced at last,” he said. “It did not
    come from here. It was put through to Dr. Sheppard at 10.15 last night
    from a public call office at King’s Abbot station. And at 10.23 the
    night mail leaves for Liverpool.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<div class="subhead">INSPECTOR RAGLAN IS CONFIDENT</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> looked at each other.</p>
<p>“You’ll have inquiries made at the station, of course?” I said.</p>
<p>“Naturally, but I’m not over sanguine as to the result. You know what
    that station is like.”</p>
<p>I did. King’s Abbot is a mere village, but its station happens to
    be an important junction. Most of the big expresses stop there, and
    trains are shunted, re-sorted, and made up. It has two or three public
    telephone boxes. At that time of night three local trains come in
    close upon each other, to catch the connection with the express for
    the north which comes in at 10.19 and leaves at 10.23. The whole place
    is in a bustle, and the chances of one particular person being noticed
    telephoning or getting into the express are very small indeed.</p>
<p>“But why telephone at all?” demanded Melrose. “That is what I find so
    extraordinary. There seems no rhyme or reason in the thing.”</p>
<p>Poirot carefully straightened a china ornament on one of the bookcases.</p>
<p>“Be sure there was a reason,” he said over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“But what reason could it be?”</p>
<p>“When we know that, we shall know everything. This case is very curious
    and very interesting.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>
<p>There was something almost indescribable in the way he said those last
    words. I felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle
    of his own, and what he saw I could not tell.</p>
<p>He went to the window and stood there, looking out.</p>
<p>“You say it was nine o’clock, Dr. Sheppard, when you met this stranger
    outside the gate?”</p>
<p>He asked the question without turning round.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I replied. “I heard the church clock chime the hour.”</p>
<p>“How long would it take him to reach the house—to reach this window,
    for instance?”</p>
<p>“Five minutes at the outside. Two or three minutes only if he took the
    path at the right of the drive and came straight here.”</p>
<p>“But to do that he would have to know the way. How can I explain
    myself?—it would mean that he had been here before—that he knew his
    surroundings.”</p>
<p>“That is true,” replied Colonel Melrose.</p>
<p>“We could find out, doubtless, if Mr. Ackroyd had received any
    strangers during the past week?”</p>
<p>“Young Raymond could tell us that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Or Parker,” suggested Colonel Melrose.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Ou tous les deux</i>,” suggested Poirot, smiling.</p>
<p>Colonel Melrose went in search of Raymond, and I rang the bell once
    more for Parker.</p>
<p>Colonel Melrose returned almost immediately, accompanied by the young
    secretary, whom he introduced to Poirot. Geoffrey Raymond was fresh and
    debonair as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> ever. He seemed surprised and delighted to make Poirot’s
    acquaintance.</p>
<p>“No idea you’d been living among us incognito, M. Poirot,” he said. “It
    will be a great privilege to watch you at work——Hallo, what’s this?”</p>
<p>Poirot had been standing just to the left of the door. Now he moved
    aside suddenly, and I saw that while my back was turned he must have
    swiftly drawn out the arm-chair till it stood in the position Parker
    had indicated.</p>
<p>“Want me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test?” asked
    Raymond good-humoredly. “What’s the idea?”</p>
<p>“M. Raymond, this chair was pulled out—so—last night when Mr. Ackroyd
    was found killed. Some one moved it back again into place. Did you do
    so?”</p>
<p>The secretary’s reply came without a second’s hesitation.</p>
<p>“No, indeed I didn’t. I don’t even remember that it was in that
    position, but it must have been if you say so. Anyway, somebody else
    must have moved it back to its proper place. Have they destroyed a clew
    in doing so? Too bad!”</p>
<p>“It is of no consequence,” said the detective. “Of no consequence
    whatever. What I really want to ask you is this, M. Raymond: Did any
    stranger come to see Mr. Ackroyd during this past week?”</p>
<p>The secretary reflected for a minute or two, knitting his brows, and
    during the pause Parker appeared in answer to the bell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>
<p>“No,” said Raymond at last. “I can’t remember any one. Can you, Parker?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, sir?”</p>
<p>“Any stranger coming to see Mr. Ackroyd this week?”</p>
<p>The butler reflected for a minute or two.</p>
<p>“There was the young man who came on Wednesday, sir,” he said at last.
    “From Curtis and Troute, I understood he was.”</p>
<p>Raymond moved this aside with an impatient hand.</p>
<p>“Oh! yes, I remember, but that is not the kind of stranger this
    gentleman means.” He turned to Poirot. “Mr. Ackroyd had some idea of
    purchasing a dictaphone,” he explained. “It would have enabled us to
    get through a lot more work in a limited time. The firm in question
    sent down their representative, but nothing came of it. Mr. Ackroyd did
    not make up his mind to purchase.”</p>
<p>Poirot turned to the butler.</p>
<p>“Can you describe this young man to me, my good Parker?”</p>
<p>“He was fair-haired, sir, and short. Very neatly dressed in a blue
    serge suit. A very presentable young man, sir, for his station in life.”</p>
<p>Poirot turned to me.</p>
<p>“The man you met outside the gate, doctor, was tall, was he not?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Somewhere about six feet, I should say.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing in that, then,” declared the Belgian. “I thank you,
    Parker.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>
<p>The butler spoke to Raymond.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hammond has just arrived, sir,” he said. “He is anxious to know if
    he can be of any service, and he would be glad to have a word with you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come at once,” said the young man. He hurried out. Poirot looked
    inquiringly at the chief constable.</p>
<p>“The family solicitor, M. Poirot,” said the latter.</p>
<p>“It is a busy time for this young M. Raymond,” murmured M. Poirot. “He
    has the air efficient, that one.”</p>
<p>“I believe Mr. Ackroyd considered him a most able secretary.”</p>
<p>“He has been here—how long?”</p>
<p>“Just on two years, I fancy.”</p>
<p>“His duties he fulfills punctiliously. Of that I am sure. In what
    manner does he amuse himself? Does he go in for <i lang="fr">le sport</i>?”</p>
<p>“Private secretaries haven’t much time for that sort of thing,” said
    Colonel Melrose, smiling. “Raymond plays golf, I believe. And tennis in
    the summer time.”</p>
<p>“He does not attend the courses—I should say the running of the horses?”</p>
<p>“Race meetings? No, I don’t think he’s interested in racing.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded and seemed to lose interest. He glanced slowly round the
    study.</p>
<p>“I have seen, I think, all that there is to be seen here.”</p>
<p>I, too, looked round.</p>
<p>“If those walls could speak,” I murmured.</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head.</p>
<p>“A tongue is not enough,” he said. “They would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> to have also eyes
    and ears. But do not be too sure that these dead things”—he touched
    the top of the bookcase as he spoke—“are always dumb. To me they speak
    sometimes—chairs, tables—they have their message!”</p>
<p>He turned away towards the door.</p>
<p>“What message?” I cried. “What have they said to you to-day?”</p>
<p>He looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically.</p>
<p>“An opened window,” he said. “A locked door. A chair that apparently
    moved itself. To all three I say, ‘Why?’ and I find no answer.”</p>
<p>He shook his head, puffed out his chest, and stood blinking at us. He
    looked ridiculously full of his own importance. It crossed my mind
    to wonder whether he was really any good as a detective. Had his big
    reputation been built up on a series of lucky chances?</p>
<p>I think the same thought must have occurred to Colonel Melrose, for he
    frowned.</p>
<p>“Anything more you want to see, M. Poirot?” he inquired brusquely.</p>
<p>“You would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from which
    the weapon was taken? After that, I will trespass on your kindness no
    longer.”</p>
<p>We went to the drawing-room, but on the way the constable waylaid the
    colonel, and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself
    and left us together. I showed Poirot the silver table, and after
    raising the lid once or twice and letting it fall, he pushed open the
    window and stepped out on the terrace. I followed him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>
<p>Inspector Raglan had just turned the corner of the house, and was
    coming towards us. His face looked grim and satisfied.</p>
<p>“So there you are, M. Poirot,” he said. “Well, this isn’t going to be
    much of a case. I’m sorry, too. A nice enough young fellow gone wrong.”</p>
<p>Poirot’s face fell, and he spoke very mildly.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I shall not be able to be of much aid to you, then?”</p>
<p>“Next time, perhaps,” said the inspector soothingly. “Though we don’t
    have murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.”</p>
<p>Poirot’s gaze took on an admiring quality.</p>
<p>“You have been of a marvelous promptness,” he observed. “How exactly
    did you go to work, if I may ask?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said the inspector. “To begin with—method. That’s what I
    always say—method!”</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried the other. “That, too, is my watchword. Method, order, and
    the little gray cells.”</p>
<p>“The cells?” said the inspector, staring.</p>
<p>“The little gray cells of the brain,” explained the Belgian.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course; well, we all use them, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“In a greater or lesser degree,” murmured Poirot. “And there are, too,
    differences in quality. Then there is the psychology of a crime. One
    must study that.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the inspector, “you’ve been bitten with all this
    psychoanalysis stuff? Now, I’m a plain man——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>
<p>“Mrs. Raglan would not agree, I am sure, to that,” said Poirot, making
    him a little bow.</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan, a little taken aback, bowed.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” he said, grinning broadly. “Lord, what a lot of
    difference language makes. I’m telling you how I set to work. First of
    all, method. Mr. Ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his
    niece, Miss Flora Ackroyd. That’s fact number one, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“If you say so.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is. At half-past ten, the doctor here says that Mr. Ackroyd
    has been dead at least half an hour. You stick to that, doctor?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” I said. “Half an hour or longer.”</p>
<p>“Very good. That gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the
    crime must have been committed. I make a list of every one in the
    house, and work through it, setting down opposite their names where
    they were and what they were doing between the hour of 9.45 and 10 p.m.”</p>
<p>He handed a sheet of paper to Poirot. I read it over his shoulder. It
    ran as follows, written in a neat script:—</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p class="hang"><i>Major Blunt.—In billiard room with Mr. Raymond. (Latter
      confirms.)</i></p>
<p class="hang"><i>Mr. Raymond.—Billiard room. (See above.)</i></p>
<p class="hang"><i>Mrs. Ackroyd.—9.45 watching billiard match. Went up to bed 9.55.
      (Raymond and Blunt watched her up staircase.)</i> </p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>
<p class="hang"><i>Miss Ackroyd.—Went straight from her uncle’s room upstairs.
      (Confirmed by Parker, also housemaid, Elsie Dale.)</i></p>
<p class="hang"><i>Servants</i>:—</p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Parker.—Went straight to butler’s pantry. (Confirmed by
      housekeeper, Miss Russell, who came down to speak to him about
      something at 9.47, and remained at least ten minutes.)</i></p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Miss Russell.—As above. Spoke to housemaid, Elsie Dale, upstairs
      at 9.45.</i></p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Ursula Bourne (parlormaid).—In her own room until 9.55. Then in
      Servants’ Hall.</i></p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Mrs. Cooper (cook).—In Servants’ Hall.</i></p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Gladys Jones (second housemaid).—In Servants’ Hall.</i></p>

      Miss Flora Ackroyd.</i></p>
<p class="hang2"><i>Mary Thripp (kitchenmaid).—Servants’ Hall.</i></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“The cook has been here seven years, the parlormaid eighteen months,
    and Parker just over a year. The others are new. Except for something
    fishy about Parker, they all seem quite all right.”</p>
<p>“A very complete list,” said Poirot, handing it back to him. “I am
    quite sure that Parker did not do the murder,” he added gravely.</p>
<p>“So is my sister,” I struck in. “And she’s usually right.” Nobody paid
    any attention to my interpolation.</p>
<p>“That disposes pretty effectually of the household,” continued the
    inspector. “Now we come to a very grave point. The woman at the
    lodge—Mary Black—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> pulling the curtains last night when she saw
    Ralph Paton turn in at the gate and go up towards the house.”</p>
<p>“She is sure of that?” I asked sharply.</p>
<p>“Quite sure. She knows him well by sight. He went past very quickly
    and turned off by the path to the right, which is a short cut to the
    terrace.”</p>
<p>“And what time was that?” asked Poirot, who had sat with an immovable
    face.</p>
<p>“Exactly twenty-five minutes past nine,” said the inspector gravely.</p>
<p>There was a silence. Then the inspector spoke again.</p>
<p>“It’s all clear enough. It fits in without a flaw. At twenty-five
    minutes past nine, Captain Paton is seen passing the lodge; at
    nine-thirty or thereabouts, Mr. Geoffrey Raymond hears some one in here
    asking for money and Mr. Ackroyd refusing. What happens next? Captain
    Paton leaves the same way—through the window. He walks along the
    terrace, angry and baffled. He comes to the open drawing-room window.
    Say it’s now a quarter to ten. Miss Flora Ackroyd is saying good-night
    to her uncle. Major Blunt, Mr. Raymond, and Mrs. Ackroyd are in the
    billiard room. The drawing-room is empty. He steals in, takes the
    dagger from the silver table, and returns to the study window. He slips
    off his shoes, climbs in, and—well, I don’t need to go into details.
    Then he slips out again and goes off. Hadn’t the nerve to go back to
    the inn. He makes for the station, rings up from there——”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Poirot softly.</p>
<p>I jumped at the interruption. The little man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> leaning forward. His
    eyes shone with a queer green light.</p>
<p>For a moment Inspector Raglan was taken aback by the question.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to say exactly why he did that,” he said at last. “But
    murderers do funny things. You’d know that if you were in the police
    force. The cleverest of them make stupid mistakes sometimes. But come
    along and I’ll show you those footprints.”</p>
<p>We followed him round the corner of the terrace to the study window. At
    a word from Raglan a police constable produced the shoes which had been
    obtained from the local inn.</p>
<p>The inspector laid them over the marks.</p>
<p>“They’re the same,” he said confidently. “That is to say, they’re not
    the same pair that actually made these prints. He went away in those.
    This is a pair just like them, but older—see how the studs are worn
    down.”</p>
<p>“Surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them?”
    asked Poirot.</p>
<p>“That’s so, of course,” said the inspector. “I shouldn’t put so much
    stress on the footmarks if it wasn’t for everything else.”</p>
<p>“A very foolish young man, Captain Ralph Paton,” said Poirot
    thoughtfully. “To leave so much evidence of his presence.”</p>
<p>“Ah! well,” said the inspector, “it was a dry, fine night, you know. He
    left no prints on the terrace or on the graveled path. But, unluckily
    for him, a spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> must have welled up just lately at the end of the
    path from the drive. See here.”</p>
<p>A small graveled path joined the terrace a few feet away. In one
    spot, a few yards from its termination, the ground was wet and boggy.
    Crossing this wet place there were again the marks of footsteps, and
    amongst them the shoes with rubber studs.</p>
<p>Poirot followed the path on a little way, the inspector by his side.</p>
<p>“You noticed the women’s footprints?” he said suddenly.</p>
<p>The inspector laughed.</p>
<p>“Naturally. But several different women have walked this way—and men
    as well. It’s a regular short cut to the house, you see. It would be
    impossible to sort out all the footsteps. After all, it’s the ones on
    the window-sill that are really important.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s no good going farther,” said the inspector, as we came in view of
    the drive. “It’s all graveled again here, and hard as it can be.”</p>
<p>Again Poirot nodded, but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house—a
    kind of superior summer-house. It was a little to the left of the path
    ahead of us, and a graveled walk ran up to it.</p>
<p>Poirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the
    house. Then he looked at me.</p>
<p>“You must have indeed been sent from the good God to replace my
    friend Hastings,” he said, with a twinkle. “I observe that you do not
    quit my side. How say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> you, Dr. Sheppard, shall we investigate that
    summer-house? It interests me.”</p>
<p>He went up to the door and opened it. Inside, the place was almost
    dark. There were one or two rustic seats, a croquet set, and some
    folded deck-chairs.</p>
<p>I was startled to observe my new friend. He had dropped to his hands
    and knees and was crawling about the floor. Every now and then he shook
    his head as though not satisfied. Finally, he sat back on his heels.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he murmured. “Well, perhaps it was not to be expected. But
    it would have meant so much——”</p>
<p>He broke off, stiffening all over. Then he stretched out his hand to
    one of the rustic chairs. He detached something from one side of it.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I cried. “What have you found?”</p>
<p>He smiled, unclosing his hand so that I should see what lay in the palm
    of it. A scrap of stiff white cambric.</p>
<p>I took it from him, looked at it curiously, and then handed it back.</p>
<p>“What do you make of it, eh, my friend?” he asked, eyeing me keenly.</p>
<p>“A scrap torn from a handkerchief,” I suggested, shrugging my shoulders.</p>
<p>He made another dart and picked up a small quill—a goose quill by the
    look of it.</p>
<p>“And that?” he cried triumphantly. “What do you make of that?”</p>
<p>I only stared.</p>
<p>He slipped the quill into his pocket, and looked again at the scrap of
    white stuff.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>
<p>“A fragment of a handkerchief?” he mused. “Perhaps you are right. But
    remember this—<em>a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief</em>.”</p>
<p>He nodded at me triumphantly, then he put away the scrap carefully in
    his pocket-book.</p>

<div class="subhead">THE GOLDFISH POND</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> walked back to the house together. There was no sign of the
    inspector. Poirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the
    house, slowly turning his head from side to side.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Une belle propriété</i>,” he said at last appreciatively. “Who
    inherits it?”</p>
<p>His words gave me almost a shock. It is an odd thing, but until that
    moment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. Poirot
    watched me keenly.</p>
<p>“It is a new idea to you, that,” he said at last. “You had not thought
    of it before—eh?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said truthfully. “I wish I had.”</p>
<p>He looked at me again curiously.</p>
<p>“I wonder just what you mean by that,” he said thoughtfully. “Ah! no,”
    as I was about to speak. “<i lang="fr">Inutile!</i> You would not tell me your
    real thought.”</p>
<p>“Every one has something to hide,” I quoted, smiling.</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“You still believe that?”</p>
<p>“More than ever, my friend. But it is not easy to hide things from
    Hercule Poirot. He has a knack of finding out.”</p>
<p>He descended the steps of the Dutch garden as he spoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>
<p>“Let us walk a little,” he said over his shoulder. “The air is pleasant
    to-day.”</p>
<p>I followed him. He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew
    hedges. A walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal
    flower beds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and
    a pond of goldfish. Instead of pursuing the path to the end, Poirot
    took another which wound up the side of a wooded slope. In one spot the
    trees had been cleared away, and a seat had been put. Sitting there one
    had a splendid view over the countryside, and one looked right down on
    the paved recess and the goldfish pond.</p>
<p>“England is very beautiful,” said Poirot, his eyes straying over the
    prospect. Then he smiled. “And so are English girls,” he said in a
    lower tone. “Hush, my friend, and look at the pretty picture below us.”</p>
<p>It was then that I saw Flora. She was moving along the path we had
    just left and she was humming a little snatch of song. Her step was
    more dancing than walking, and in spite of her black dress, there was
    nothing but joy in her whole attitude. She gave a sudden pirouette on
    her toes, and her black draperies swung out. At the same time she flung
    her head back and laughed outright.</p>
<p>As she did so a man stepped out from the trees. It was Hector Blunt.</p>
<p>The girl started. Her expression changed a little.</p>
<p>“How you startled me—I didn’t see you.”</p>
<p>Blunt said nothing, but stood looking at her for a minute or two in
    silence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>
<p>“What I like about you,” said Flora, with a touch of malice, “is your
    cheery conversation.”</p>
<p>I fancy that at that Blunt reddened under his tan. His voice, when he
    spoke, sounded different—it had a curious sort of humility in it.</p>
<p>“Never was much of a fellow for talking. Not even when I was young.”</p>
<p>“That was a very long time ago, I suppose,” said Flora gravely.</p>
<p>I caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice, but I don’t think
    Blunt did.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said simply, “it was.”</p>
<p>“How does it feel to be Methuselah?” asked Flora.</p>
<p>This time the laughter was more apparent, but Blunt was following out
    an idea of his own.</p>
<p>“Remember the Johnny who sold his soul to the devil? In return for
    being made young again? There’s an opera about it.”</p>
<p>“Faust, you mean?”</p>
<p>“That’s the beggar. Rum story. Some of us would do it if we could.”</p>
<p>“Any one would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk,”
    cried Flora, half vexed, half amused.</p>
<p>Blunt said nothing for a minute or two. Then he looked away from Flora
    into the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it
    was about time he got back to Africa.</p>
<p>“Are you going on another expedition—shooting things?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>
<p>“Expect so. Usually do, you know—shoot things, I mean.”</p>
<p>“You shot that head in the hall, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Blunt nodded. Then he jerked out, going rather red, as he did so:—</p>
<p>“Care for some decent skins any time? If so, I could get ’em for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh! please do,” cried Flora. “Will you really? You won’t forget?”</p>
<p>“I shan’t forget,” said Hector Blunt.</p>
<p>He added, in a sudden burst of communicativeness:—</p>
<p>“Time I went. I’m no good in this sort of life. Haven’t got the manners
    for it. I’m a rough fellow, no use in society. Never remember the
    things one’s expected to say. Yes, time I went.”</p>
<p>“But you’re not going at once,” cried Flora. “Not—not while we’re in
    all this trouble. Oh! please. If you go——”</p>
<p>She turned away a little.</p>
<p>“You want me to stay?” asked Blunt.</p>
<p>He spoke deliberately but quite simply.</p>
<p>“We all——”</p>
<p>“I meant you personally,” said Blunt, with directness.</p>
<p>Flora turned slowly back again and met his eyes.</p>
<p>“I want you to stay,” she said, “if—if that makes any difference.”</p>
<p>“It makes all the difference,” said Blunt.</p>
<p>There was a moment’s silence. They sat down on the stone seat by the
    goldfish pond. It seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to
    say next.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>
<p>“It—it’s such a lovely morning,” said Flora at last. “You know, I can’t
    help feeling happy, in spite—in spite of everything. That’s awful, I
    suppose?”</p>
<p>“Quite natural,” said Blunt. “Never saw your uncle until two years ago,
    did you? Can’t be expected to grieve very much. Much better to have no
    humbug about it.”</p>
<p>“There’s something awfully consoling about you,” said Flora. “You make
    things so simple.”</p>
<p>“Things are simple as a rule,” said the big game hunter.</p>
<p>“Not always,” said Flora.</p>
<p>Her voice had lowered itself, and I saw Blunt turn and look at her,
    bringing his eyes back from (apparently) the coast of Africa to do so.
    He evidently put his own construction on her change of tone, for he
    said, after a minute or two, in rather an abrupt manner:—</p>
<p>“I say, you know, you mustn’t worry. About that young chap, I mean.
    Inspector’s an ass. Everybody knows—utterly absurd to think he could
    have done it. Man from outside. Burglar chap. That’s the only possible
    solution.”</p>
<p>Flora turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“You really think so?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you?” said Blunt quickly.</p>
<p>“I—oh, yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Another silence, and then Flora burst out:—</p>
<p>“I’m—I’ll tell you why I felt so happy this morning. However heartless
    you think me, I’d rather tell you. It’s because the lawyer has been—Mr.
    Hammond. He told us about the will. Uncle Roger has left me twenty
    thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> pounds. Think of it—twenty thousand beautiful pounds.”</p>
<p>Blunt looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Does it mean so much to you?”</p>
<p>“Mean much to me? Why, it’s everything. Freedom—life—no more scheming
    and scraping and lying——”</p>
<p>“Lying?” said Blunt, sharply interrupting.</p>
<p>Flora seemed taken aback for a minute.</p>
<p>“You know what I mean,” she said uncertainly. “Pretending to be
    thankful for all the nasty castoff things rich relations give you. Last
    year’s coats and skirts and hats.”</p>
<p>“Don’t know much about ladies’ clothes; should have said you were
    always very well turned out.”</p>
<p>“It’s cost me something, though,” said Flora in a low voice. “Don’t
    let’s talk of horrid things. I’m so happy. I’m free. Free to do what I
    like. Free not to——”</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>“Not to what?” asked Blunt quickly.</p>
<p>“I forget now. Nothing important.”</p>
<p>Blunt had a stick in his hand, and he thrust it into the pond, poking
    at something.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Major Blunt?”</p>
<p>“There’s something bright down there. Wondered what it was—looks like a
    gold brooch. Now I’ve stirred up the mud and it’s gone.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it’s a crown,” suggested Flora. “Like the one Mélisande saw in
    the water.”</p>
<p>“Mélisande,” said Blunt reflectively—“she’s in an opera, isn’t she?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>
<p>“Yes, you seem to know a lot about operas.”</p>
<p>“People take me sometimes,” said Blunt sadly. “Funny idea of
    pleasure—worse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms.”</p>
<p>Flora laughed.</p>
<p>“I remember Mélisande,” continued Blunt, “married an old chap old
    enough to be her father.”</p>
<p>He threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond. Then, with a
    change of manner, he turned to Flora.</p>
<p>“Miss Ackroyd, can I do anything? About Paton, I mean. I know how
    dreadfully anxious you must be.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Flora in a cold voice. “There is really nothing to
    be done. Ralph will be all right. I’ve got hold of the most wonderful
    detective in the world, and he’s going to find out all about it.”</p>
<p>For some time I had felt uneasy as to our position. We were not exactly
    eavesdropping, since the two in the garden below had only to lift their
    heads to see us. Nevertheless, I should have drawn attention to our
    presence before now, had not my companion put a warning pressure on my
    arm. Clearly he wished me to remain silent.</p>
<p>But now he rose briskly to his feet, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>“I demand pardon,” he cried. “I cannot allow mademoiselle thus
    extravagantly to compliment me, and not draw attention to my presence.
    They say the listener hears no good of himself, but that is not the
    case this time. To spare my blushes, I must join you and apologize.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>
<p>He hurried down the path with me close behind him, and joined the
    others by the pond.</p>
<p>“This is M. Hercule Poirot,” said Flora. “I expect you’ve heard of him.”</p>
<p>Poirot bowed.</p>
<p>“I know Major Blunt by reputation,” he said politely. “I am glad to
    have encountered you, monsieur. I am in need of some information that
    you can give me.”</p>
<p>Blunt looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>“When did you last see M. Ackroyd alive?”</p>
<p>“At dinner.”</p>
<p>“And you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t see him. Heard his voice.”</p>
<p>“How was that?”</p>
<p>“I strolled out on the terrace——”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, what time was this?”</p>
<p>“About half-past nine. I was walking up and down smoking in front of
    the drawing-room window. I heard Ackroyd talking in his study——”</p>
<p>Poirot stooped and removed a microscopic weed.</p>
<p>“Surely you couldn’t hear voices in the study from that part of the
    terrace,” he murmured.</p>
<p>He was not looking at Blunt, but I was, and to my intense surprise, I
    saw the latter flush.</p>
<p>“Went as far as the corner,” he explained unwillingly.</p>
<p>“Ah! indeed?” said Poirot.</p>
<p>In the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was wanted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>
<p>“Thought I saw—a woman disappearing into the bushes. Just a gleam of
    white, you know. Must have been mistaken. It was while I was standing
    at the corner of the terrace that I heard Ackroyd’s voice speaking to
    that secretary of his.”</p>
<p>“Speaking to Mr. Geoffrey Raymond?”</p>
<p>“Yes—that’s what I supposed at the time. Seems I was wrong.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd didn’t address him by name?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“Then, if I may ask, why did you think——?”</p>
<p>Blunt explained laboriously.</p>
<p>“Took it for granted that it <em>would</em> be Raymond, because he had
    said just before I came out that he was taking some papers to Ackroyd.
    Never thought of it being anybody else.”</p>
<p>“Can you remember what the words you heard were?”</p>
<p>“Afraid I can’t. Something quite ordinary and unimportant. Only caught
    a scrap of it. I was thinking of something else at the time.”</p>
<p>“It is of no importance,” murmured Poirot. “Did you move a chair back
    against the wall when you went into the study after the body was
    discovered?”</p>
<p>“Chair? No—why should I?”</p>
<p>Poirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer. He turned to Flora.</p>
<p>“There is one thing I should like to know from you, mademoiselle. When
    you were examining the things in the silver table with Dr. Sheppard,
    was the dagger in its place, or was it not?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>
<p>Flora’s chin shot up.</p>
<p>“Inspector Raglan has been asking me that,” she said resentfully.
    “I’ve told him, and I’ll tell you. I’m perfectly certain the dagger
    was <em>not</em> there. He thinks it was and that Ralph sneaked it later
    in the evening. And—and he doesn’t believe me. He thinks I’m saying it
    to—to shield Ralph.”</p>
<p>“And aren’t you?” I asked gravely.</p>
<p>Flora stamped her foot.</p>
<p>“You, too, Dr. Sheppard! Oh! it’s too bad.”</p>
<p>Poirot tactfully made a diversion.</p>
<p>“It is true what I heard you say, Major Blunt. There is something that
    glitters in this pond. Let us see if I can reach it.”</p>
<p>He knelt down by the pond, baring his arm to the elbow, and lowered it
    in very slowly, so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond. But in
    spite of all his precautions the mud eddied and swirled, and he was
    forced to draw his arm out again empty-handed.</p>
<p>He gazed ruefully at the mud upon his arm. I offered him my
    handkerchief, which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks.
    Blunt looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Nearly lunch time,” he said. “We’d better be getting back to the
    house.”</p>
<p>“You will lunch with us, M. Poirot?” asked Flora. “I should like you to
    meet my mother. She is—very fond of Ralph.”</p>
<p>The little man bowed.</p>
<p>“I shall be delighted, mademoiselle.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>
<p>“And you will stay, too, won’t you, Dr. Sheppard?”</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>“Oh, do!”</p>
<p>I wanted to, so I accepted the invitation without further ceremony.</p>
<p>We set out towards the house, Flora and Blunt walking ahead.</p>
<p>“What hair,” said Poirot to me in a low tone, nodding towards Flora.
    “The real gold! They will make a pretty couple. She and the dark,
    handsome Captain Paton. Will they not?”</p>
<p>I looked at him inquiringly, but he began to fuss about a few
    microscopic drops of water on his coat sleeve. The man reminded me in
    some ways of a cat. His green eyes and his finicking habits.</p>
<p>“And all for nothing, too,” I said sympathetically. “I wonder what it
    was in the pond?”</p>
<p>“Would you like to see?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>I stared at him. He nodded.</p>
<p>“My good friend,” he said gently and reproachfully, “Hercule Poirot
    does not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure
    of attaining his object. To do so would be ridiculous and absurd. I am
    never ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“But you brought your hand out empty,” I objected.</p>
<p>“There are times when it is necessary to have discretion. Do you tell
    your patients everything—everything, doctor? I think not. Nor do you
    tell your excellent sister everything either, is it not so? Before
    showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> my empty hand, I dropped what it contained into my other hand.
    You shall see what that was.”</p>
<p>He held out his left hand, palm open. On it lay a little circlet of
    gold. A woman’s wedding ring.</p>
<p>I took it from him.</p>
<p>“Look inside,” commanded Poirot.</p>
<p>I did so. Inside was an inscription in fine writing:—</p>
<p class="center"><i>From R., March 13th.</i></p>
<p>I looked at Poirot, but he was busy inspecting his appearance in a tiny
    pocket glass. He paid particular attention to his mustaches, and none
    at all to me. I saw that he did not intend to be communicative.</p>

<div class="subhead">THE PARLORMAID</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> found Mrs. Ackroyd in the hall. With her was a small dried-up little
    man, with an aggressive chin and sharp gray eyes, and “lawyer” written
    all over him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hammond is staying to lunch with us,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “You know
    Major Blunt, Mr. Hammond? And dear Dr. Sheppard—also a close friend of
    poor Roger’s. And, let me see——”</p>
<p>She paused, surveying Hercule Poirot in some perplexity.</p>
<p>“This is M. Poirot, mother,” said Flora. “I told you about him this
    morning.”</p>
<p>“Oh! yes,” said Mrs. Ackroyd vaguely. “Of course, my dear, of course.
    He is to find Ralph, is he not?”</p>
<p>“He is to find out who killed uncle,” said Flora.</p>
<p>“Oh! my dear,” cried her mother. “Please! My poor nerves. I am a wreck
    this morning, a positive wreck. Such a dreadful thing to happen. I
    can’t help feeling that it must have been an accident of some kind.
    Roger was so fond of handling queer curios. His hand must have slipped,
    or something.”</p>
<p>This theory was received in polite silence. I saw Poirot edge up to the
    lawyer, and speak to him in a confidential undertone. They moved aside
    into the embrasure of the window. I joined them—then hesitated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>
<p>“Perhaps I’m intruding,” I said.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” cried Poirot heartily. “You and I, M. le docteur, we
    investigate this affair side by side. Without you I should be lost. I
    desire a little information from the good Mr. Hammond.”</p>
<p>“You are acting on behalf of Captain Ralph Paton, I understand,” said
    the lawyer cautiously.</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head.</p>
<p>“Not so. I am acting in the interests of justice. Miss Ackroyd has
    asked me to investigate the death of her uncle.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond seemed slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>“I cannot seriously believe that Captain Paton can be concerned in this
    crime,” he said, “however strong the circumstantial evidence against
    him may be. The mere fact that he was hard pressed for money——”</p>
<p>“Was he hard pressed for money?” interpolated Poirot quickly.</p>
<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“It was a chronic condition with Ralph Paton,” he said dryly. “Money
    went through his hands like water. He was always applying to his
    stepfather.”</p>
<p>“Had he done so of late? During the last year, for instance?”</p>
<p>“I cannot say. Mr. Ackroyd did not mention the fact to me.”</p>
<p>“I comprehend. Mr. Hammond, I take it that you are acquainted with the
    provisions of Mr. Ackroyd’s will?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. That is my principal business here to-day.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>
<p>“Then, seeing that I am acting for Miss Ackroyd, you will not object to
    telling me the terms of that will?”</p>
<p>“They are quite simple. Shorn of legal phraseology, and after paying
    certain legacies and bequests——”</p>
<p>“Such as——?” interrupted Poirot.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond seemed a little surprised.</p>
<p>“A thousand pounds to his housekeeper, Miss Russell; fifty pounds
    to the cook, Emma Cooper; five hundred pounds to his secretary, Mr.
    Geoffrey Raymond. Then to various hospitals——”</p>
<p>Poirot held up his hand.</p>
<p>“Ah! the charitable bequests, they interest me not.”</p>
<p>“Quite so. The income on ten thousand pounds’ worth of shares to be
    paid to Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd during her lifetime. Miss Flora Ackroyd
    inherits twenty thousand pounds outright. The residue—including this
    property, and the shares in Ackroyd and Son—to his adopted son, Ralph
    Paton.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd possessed a large fortune?”</p>
<p>“A very large fortune. Captain Paton will be an exceedingly wealthy
    young man.”</p>
<p>There was a silence. Poirot and the lawyer looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Mr. Hammond,” came Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice plaintively from the fireplace.</p>
<p>The lawyer answered the summons. Poirot took my arm and drew me right
    into the window.</p>
<p>“Regard the irises,” he remarked in rather a loud voice. “Magnificent,
    are they not? A straight and pleasing effect.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>
<p>At the same time I felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and he
    added in a low tone:—</p>
<p>“Do you really wish to aid me? To take part in this investigation?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” I said eagerly. “There’s nothing I should like better.
    You don’t know what a dull old fogey’s life I lead. Never anything out
    of the ordinary.”</p>
<p>“Good, we will be colleagues then. In a minute or two I fancy Major
    Blunt will join us. He is not happy with the good mamma. Now there are
    some things I want to know—but I do not wish to seem to want to know
    them. You comprehend? So it will be your part to ask the questions.”</p>
<p>“What questions do you want me to ask?” I asked apprehensively.</p>
<p>“I want you to introduce the name of Mrs. Ferrars.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Speak of her in a natural fashion. Ask him if he was down here when
    her husband died. You understand the kind of thing I mean. And while
    he replies, watch his face without seeming to watch it. <i lang="fr">C’est
    compris?</i>”</p>
<p>There was no time for more, for at that minute, as Poirot had
    prophesied, Blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over
    to us.</p>
<p>I suggested strolling on the terrace, and he acquiesced. Poirot stayed
    behind.</p>
<p>I stopped to examine a late rose.</p>
<p>“How things change in the course of a day or so,” I observed. “I was
    up here last Wednesday, I remember, walking up and down this same
    terrace. Ackroyd was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> with me—full of spirits. And now—three days
    later—Ackroyd’s dead, poor fellow, Mrs. Ferrars’s dead—you knew her,
    didn’t you? But of course you did.”</p>
<p>Blunt nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Had you seen her since you’d been down this time?”</p>
<p>“Went with Ackroyd to call. Last Tuesday, think it was. Fascinating
    woman—but something queer about her. Deep—one would never know what she
    was up to.”</p>
<p>I looked into his steady gray eyes. Nothing there surely. I went on:—</p>
<p>“I suppose you’d met her before.”</p>
<p>“Last time I was here—she and her husband had just come here to live.”
    He paused a minute and then added: “Rum thing, she had changed a lot
    between then and now.”</p>
<p>“How—changed?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Looked ten years older.”</p>
<p>“Were you down here when her husband died?” I asked, trying to make the
    question sound as casual as possible.</p>
<p>“No. From all I heard it would be a good riddance. Uncharitable,
    perhaps, but the truth.”</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>“Ashley Ferrars was by no means a pattern husband,” I said cautiously.</p>
<p>“Blackguard, I thought,” said Blunt.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, “only a man with more money than was good for him.”</p>
<p>“Oh! money! All the troubles in the world can be put down to money—or
    the lack of it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>
<p>“Which has been your particular trouble?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve enough for what I want. I’m one of the lucky ones.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“I’m not too flush just now, as a matter of fact. Came into a legacy a
    year ago, and like a fool let myself be persuaded into putting it into
    some wild-cat scheme.”</p>
<p>I sympathized, and narrated my own similar trouble.</p>
<p>Then the gong pealed out, and we all went in to lunch. Poirot drew me
    back a little.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Eh! bien?</i>”</p>
<p>“He’s all right,” I said. “I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>“Nothing—disturbing?”</p>
<p>“He had a legacy just a year ago,” I said. “But why not? Why shouldn’t
    he? I’ll swear the man is perfectly square and aboveboard.”</p>
<p>“Without doubt, without doubt,” said Poirot soothingly. “Do not upset
    yourself.”</p>
<p>He spoke as though to a fractious child.</p>
<p>We all trooped into the dining-room. It seemed incredible that less
    than twenty-four hours had passed since I last sat at that table.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mrs. Ackroyd took me aside and sat down with me on a sofa.</p>
<p>“I can’t help feeling a little hurt,” she murmured, producing a
    handkerchief of the kind obviously not meant to be cried into. “Hurt, I
    mean, by Roger’s lack of confidence in me. That twenty thousand pounds
    ought to have been left to <em>me</em>—not to Flora. A mother could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
    trusted to safeguard the interests of her child. A lack of trust, I
    call it.”</p>
<p>“You forget, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “Flora was Ackroyd’s own niece, a
    blood relation. It would have been different had you been his sister
    instead of his sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“As poor Cecil’s widow, I think my feelings ought to have been
    considered,” said the lady, touching her eye-lashes gingerly with
    the handkerchief. “But Roger was always most peculiar—not to say
    <em>mean</em>—about money matters. It has been a most difficult position
    for both Flora and myself. He did not even give the poor child an
    allowance. He would pay her bills, you know, and even that with a good
    deal of reluctance and asking what she wanted all those fal-lals for—so
    like a man—but—now I’ve forgotten what it was I was going to say!
    Oh, yes, not a penny we could call our own, you know. Flora resented
    it—yes, I must say she resented it—very strongly. Though devoted to
    her uncle, of course. But any girl would have resented it. Yes, I must
    say Roger had very strange ideas about money. He wouldn’t even buy new
    face towels, though I told him the old ones were in holes. And then,”
    proceeded Mrs. Ackroyd, with a sudden leap highly characteristic of
    her conversation, “to leave all that money—a thousand pounds—fancy, a
    thousand pounds!—to that woman.”</p>
<p>“What woman?”</p>
<p>“That Russell woman. Something very queer about her, and so I’ve always
    said. But Roger wouldn’t hear a word against her. Said she was a woman
    of great force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> character, and that he admired and respected her.
    He was always going on about her rectitude and independence and moral
    worth. <em>I</em> think there’s something fishy about her. She was
    certainly doing her best to marry Roger. But I soon put a stop to that.
    She’s always hated me. Naturally. <em>I</em> saw through her.”</p>
<p>I began to wonder if there was any chance of stemming Mrs. Ackroyd’s
    eloquence, and getting away.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond provided the necessary diversion by coming up to say
    good-by. I seized my chance and rose also.</p>
<p>“About the inquest,” I said. “Where would you prefer it to be held.
    Here, or at the Three Boars?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd stared at me with a dropped jaw.</p>
<p>“The inquest?” she asked, the picture of consternation. “But surely
    there won’t have to be an inquest?”</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond gave a dry little cough and murmured, “Inevitable. Under
    the circumstances,” in two short little barks.</p>
<p>“But surely Dr. Sheppard can arrange——”</p>
<p>“There are limits to my powers of arrangement,” I said dryly.</p>
<p>“If his death was an accident——”</p>
<p>“He was murdered, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brutally.</p>
<p>She gave a little cry.</p>
<p>“No theory of accident will hold water for a minute.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd looked at me in distress. I had no patience with what I
    thought was her silly fear of unpleasantness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>
<p>“If there’s an inquest, I—I shan’t have to answer questions and all
    that, shall I?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what will be necessary,” I answered. “I imagine
    Mr. Raymond will take the brunt of it off you. He knows all the
    circumstances, and can give formal evidence of identification.”</p>
<p>The lawyer assented with a little bow.</p>
<p>“I really don’t think there is anything to dread, Mrs. Ackroyd,” he
    said. “You will be spared all unpleasantness. Now, as to the question
    of money, have you all you need for the present? I mean,” he added, as
    she looked at him inquiringly, “ready money. Cash, you know. If not, I
    can arrange to let you have whatever you require.”</p>
<p>“That ought to be all right,” said Raymond, who was standing by. “Mr.
    Ackroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday.”</p>
<p>“A hundred pounds?”</p>
<p>“Yes. For wages and other expenses due to-day. At the moment it is
    still intact.”</p>
<p>“Where is this money? In his desk?”</p>
<p>“No, he always kept his cash in his bedroom. In an old collar-box, to
    be accurate. Funny idea, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I think,” said the lawyer, “we ought to make sure the money is there
    before I leave.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” agreed the secretary. “I’ll take you up now.... Oh! I
    forgot. The door’s locked.”</p>
<p>Inquiry from Parker elicited the information that Inspector Raglan was
    in the housekeeper’s room asking a few supplementary questions. A few
    minutes later the inspector joined the party in the hall, bringing the
    key with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> him. He unlocked the door and we passed into the lobby and up
    the small staircase. At the top of the stairs the door into Ackroyd’s
    bedroom stood open. Inside the room it was dark, the curtains were
    drawn, and the bed was turned down just as it had been last night. The
    inspector drew the curtains, letting in the sunlight, and Geoffrey
    Raymond went to the top drawer of a rosewood bureau.</p>
<p>“He kept his money like that, in an unlocked drawer. Just fancy,”
    commented the inspector.</p>
<p>The secretary flushed a little.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants,” he
    said hotly.</p>
<p>“Oh! quite so,” said the inspector hastily.</p>
<p>Raymond opened the drawer, took out a round leather collar-box from the
    back of it, and opening it, drew out a thick wallet.</p>
<p>“Here is the money,” he said, taking out a fat roll of notes. “You
    will find the hundred intact, I know, for Mr. Ackroyd put it in the
    collar-box in my presence last night when he was dressing for dinner,
    and of course it has not been touched since.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond took the roll from him and counted it. He looked up sharply.</p>
<p>“A hundred pounds, you said. But there is only sixty here.”</p>
<p>Raymond stared at him.</p>
<p>“Impossible,” he cried, springing forward. Taking the notes from the
    other’s hand, he counted them aloud.</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond had been right. The total amounted to sixty pounds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>
<p>“But—I can’t understand it,” cried the secretary, bewildered.</p>
<p>Poirot asked a question.</p>
<p>“You saw Mr. Ackroyd put this money away last night when he was
    dressing for dinner? You are sure he had not paid away any of it
    already?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure he hadn’t. He even said, ‘I don’t want to take a hundred
    pounds down to dinner with me. Too bulgy.’”</p>
<p>“Then the affair is very simple,” remarked Poirot. “Either he paid out
    that forty pounds sometime last evening, or else it has been stolen.”</p>
<p>“That’s the matter in a nutshell,” agreed the inspector. He turned
    to Mrs. Ackroyd. “Which of the servants would come in here yesterday
    evening?”</p>
<p>“I suppose the housemaid would turn down the bed.”</p>
<p>“Who is she? What do you know about her?”</p>
<p>“She’s not been here very long,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “But she’s a nice
    ordinary country girl.”</p>
<p>“I think we ought to clear this matter up,” said the inspector. “If
    Mr. Ackroyd paid that money away himself, it may have a bearing on the
    mystery of the crime. The other servants all right, as far as you know?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Not missed anything before?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“None of them leaving, or anything like that?”</p>
<p>“The parlormaid is leaving.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“She gave notice yesterday, I believe.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>
<p>“To you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. <em>I</em> have nothing to do with the servants. Miss Russell
    attends to the household matters.”</p>
<p>The inspector remained lost in thought for a minute or two. Then he
    nodded his head and remarked, “I think I’d better have a word with Miss
    Russell, and I’ll see the girl Dale as well.”</p>
<p>Poirot and I accompanied him to the housekeeper’s room. Miss Russell
    received us with her usual sang-froid.</p>
<p>Elsie Dale had been at Fernly five months. A nice girl, quick at her
    duties, and most respectable. Good references. The last girl in the
    world to take anything not belonging to her.</p>
<p>What about the parlormaid?</p>
<p>“She, too, was a most superior girl. Very quiet and ladylike. An
    excellent worker.”</p>
<p>“Then why is she leaving?” asked the inspector.</p>
<p>Miss Russell pursed up her lips.</p>
<p>“It was none of my doing. I understand Mr. Ackroyd found fault with
    her yesterday afternoon. It was her duty to do the study, and she
    disarranged some of the papers on his desk, I believe. He was very
    annoyed about it, and she gave notice. At least, that is what I
    understood from her, but perhaps you’d like to see her yourselves?”</p>
<p>The inspector assented. I had already noticed the girl when she was
    waiting on us at lunch. A tall girl, with a lot of brown hair rolled
    tightly away at the back of her neck, and very steady gray eyes. She
    came in answer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> the housekeeper’s summons, and stood very straight
    with those same gray eyes fixed on us.</p>
<p>“You are Ursula Bourne?” asked the inspector.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“I understand you are leaving?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“I disarranged some papers on Mr. Ackroyd’s desk. He was very angry
    about it, and I said I had better leave. He told me to go as soon as
    possible.”</p>
<p>“Were you in Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom at all last night? Tidying up or
    anything?”</p>
<p>“No, sir. That is Elsie’s work. I never went near that part of the
    house.”</p>
<p>“I must tell you, my girl, that a large sum of money is missing from
    Mr. Ackroyd’s room.”</p>
<p>At last I saw her roused. A wave of color swept over her face.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about any money. If you think I took it, and that that
    is why Mr. Ackroyd dismissed me, you are wrong.”</p>
<p>“I’m not accusing you of taking it, my girl,” said the inspector.
    “Don’t flare up so.”</p>
<p>The girl looked at him coldly.</p>
<p>“You can search my things if you like,” she said disdainfully. “But you
    won’t find anything.”</p>
<p>Poirot suddenly interposed.</p>
<p>“It was yesterday afternoon that Mr. Ackroyd dismissed you—or you
    dismissed yourself, was it not?” he asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>“How long did the interview last?”</p>
<p>“The interview?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the interview between you and Mr. Ackroyd in the study?”</p>
<p>“I—I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Twenty minutes? Half an hour?”</p>
<p>“Something like that.”</p>
<p>“Not longer?”</p>
<p>“Not longer than half an hour, certainly.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, mademoiselle.”</p>
<p>I looked curiously at him. He was rearranging a few objects on the
    table, setting them straight with precise fingers. His eyes were
    shining.</p>
<p>“That’ll do,” said the inspector.</p>
<p>Ursula Bourne disappeared. The inspector turned to Miss Russell.</p>
<p>“How long has she been here? Have you got a copy of the reference you
    had with her?”</p>
<p>Without answering the first question, Miss Russell moved to an adjacent
    bureau, opened one of the drawers, and took out a handful of letters
    clipped together with a patent fastener. She selected one and handed it
    to the inspector.</p>
<p>“H’m,” said he. “Reads all right. Mrs. Richard Folliott, Marby Grange,
    Marby. Who’s this woman?”</p>
<p>“Quite good county people,” said Miss Russell.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the inspector, handing it back, “let’s have a look at the
    other one, Elsie Dale.”</p>
<p>Elsie Dale was a big fair girl, with a pleasant but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> slightly stupid
    face. She answered our questions readily enough, and showed much
    distress and concern at the loss of the money.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her,” observed the
    inspector, after he had dismissed her.</p>
<p>“What about Parker?”</p>
<p>Miss Russell pursed her lips together and made no reply.</p>
<p>“I’ve a feeling there’s something wrong about that man,” the inspector
    continued thoughtfully. “The trouble is that I don’t quite see when he
    got his opportunity. He’d be busy with his duties immediately after
    dinner, and he’s got a pretty good alibi all through the evening. I
    know, for I’ve been devoting particular attention to it. Well, thank
    you very much, Miss Russell. We’ll leave things as they are for the
    present. It’s highly probable Mr. Ackroyd paid that money away himself.”</p>
<p>The housekeeper bade us a dry good-afternoon, and we took our leave.</p>
<p>I left the house with Poirot.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” I said, breaking the silence, “what the papers the girl
    disarranged could have been for Ackroyd to have got into such a state
    about them? I wonder if there is any clew there to the mystery.”</p>
<p>“The secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on
    the desk,” said Poirot quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, but——” I paused.</p>
<p>“It strikes you as odd that Ackroyd should have flown into a rage about
    so trivial a matter?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it does rather.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>
<p>“But was it a trivial matter?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” I admitted, “we don’t know what those papers may have
    been. But Raymond certainly said——”</p>
<p>“Leave M. Raymond out of it for a minute. What did you think of that
    girl?”</p>
<p>“Which girl? The parlormaid?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the parlormaid. Ursula Bourne.”</p>
<p>“She seemed a nice girl,” I said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Poirot repeated my words, but whereas I had laid a slight stress on the
    fourth word, he put it on the second.</p>
<p>“She <em>seemed</em> a nice girl—yes.”</p>
<p>Then, after a minute’s silence, he took something from his pocket and
    handed it to me.</p>
<p>“See, my friend, I will show you something. Look there.”</p>
<p>The paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and given
    by him to Poirot that morning. Following the pointing finger, I saw a
    small cross marked in pencil opposite the name Ursula Bourne.</p>
<p>“You may not have noticed it at the time, my good friend, but there was
    one person on this list whose alibi had no kind of confirmation. Ursula
    Bourne.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think——”</p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard, I dare to think anything. Ursula Bourne may have killed
    Mr. Ackroyd, but I confess I can see no motive for her doing so. Can
    you?”</p>
<p>He looked at me very hard—so hard that I felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Can you?” he repeated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>
<p>“No motive whatsoever,” I said firmly.</p>
<p>His gaze relaxed. He frowned and murmured to himself:—</p>
<p>“Since the blackmailer was a man, it follows that she cannot be the
    blackmailer, then——”</p>
<p>I coughed.</p>
<p>“As far as that goes——” I began doubtfully.</p>
<p>He spun round on me.</p>
<p>“What? What are you going to say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Nothing. Only that, strictly speaking, Mrs. Ferrars in her
    letter mentioned a <em>person</em>—she didn’t actually specify a man. But
    we took it for granted, Ackroyd and I, that it <em>was</em> a man.”</p>
<p>Poirot did not seem to be listening to me. He was muttering to himself
    again.</p>
<p>“But then it is possible after all—yes, certainly it is possible—but
    then—ah! I must rearrange my ideas. Method, order; never have I needed
    them more. Everything must fit in—in its appointed place—otherwise I am
    on the wrong tack.”</p>
<p>He broke off, and whirled round upon me again.</p>
<p>“Where is Marby?”</p>
<p>“It’s on the other side of Cranchester.”</p>
<p>“How far away?”</p>
<p>“Oh!—fourteen miles, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Would it be possible for you to go there? To-morrow, say?”</p>
<p>“To-morrow? Let me see, that’s Sunday. Yes, I could arrange it. What do
    you want me to do there?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>
<p>“See this Mrs. Folliott. Find out all you can about Ursula Bourne.”</p>
<p>“Very well. But—I don’t much care for the job.”</p>
<p>“It is not the time to make difficulties. A man’s life may hang on
    this.”</p>
<p>“Poor Ralph,” I said with a sigh. “You believe him to be innocent,
    though?”</p>
<p>Poirot looked at me very gravely.</p>
<p>“Do you want to know the truth?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Then you shall have it. My friend, everything points to the assumption
    that he is guilty.”</p>
<p>“What!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, that stupid inspector—for he is stupid—has everything pointing
    his way. I seek for the truth—and the truth leads me every time to
    Ralph Paton. Motive, opportunity, means. But I will leave no stone
    unturned. I promised Mademoiselle Flora. And she was very sure, that
    little one. But very sure indeed.”</p>

<div class="subhead">POIROT PAYS A CALL</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> slightly nervous when I rang the bell at Marby Grange the
    following afternoon. I wondered very much what Poirot expected to
    find out. He had entrusted the job to me. Why? Was it because, as
    in the case of questioning Major Blunt, he wished to remain in the
    background? The wish, intelligible in the first case, seemed to me
    quite meaningless here.</p>
<p>My meditations were interrupted by the advent of a smart parlormaid.</p>
<p>Yes, Mrs. Folliott was at home. I was ushered into a big drawing-room,
    and looked round me curiously as I waited for the mistress of the
    house. A large bare room, some good bits of old china, and some
    beautiful etchings, shabby covers and curtains. A lady’s room in every
    sense of the term.</p>
<p>I turned from the inspection of a Bartolozzi on the wall as Mrs.
    Folliott came into the room. She was a tall woman, with untidy brown
    hair, and a very winning smile.</p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard,” she said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“That is my name,” I replied. “I must apologize for calling upon you
    like this, but I wanted some information about a parlormaid previously
    employed by you, Ursula Bourne.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>
<p>With the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face, and
    all the cordiality froze out of her manner. She looked uncomfortable
    and ill at ease.</p>
<p>“Ursula Bourne?” she said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Perhaps you don’t remember the name?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, of course. I—I remember perfectly.”</p>
<p>“She left you just over a year ago, I understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, she did. That is quite right.”</p>
<p>“And you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you? How long was
    she with you, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Oh! a year or two—I can’t remember exactly how long. She—she is very
    capable. I’m sure you will find her quite satisfactory. I didn’t know
    she was leaving Fernly. I hadn’t the least idea of it.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me anything about her?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Anything about her?”</p>
<p>“Yes, where she comes from, who her people are—that sort of thing?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Folliott’s face wore more than ever its frozen look.</p>
<p>“I don’t know at all.”</p>
<p>“Who was she with before she came to you?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>There was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness. She flung up
    her head in a gesture that was vaguely familiar.</p>
<p>“Is it really necessary to ask all these questions?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said, with an air of surprise and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> tinge of apology
    in my manner. “I had no idea you would mind answering them. I am very
    sorry.”</p>
<p>Her anger left her and she became confused again.</p>
<p>“Oh! I don’t mind answering them. I assure you I don’t. Why should I?
    It—it just seemed a little odd, you know. That’s all. A little odd.”</p>
<p>One advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually
    tell when people are lying to you. I should have known from Mrs.
    Folliott’s manner, if from nothing else, that she did mind answering my
    questions—minded intensely. She was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset,
    and there was plainly some mystery in the background. I judged her to
    be a woman quite unused to deception of any kind, and consequently
    rendered acutely uneasy when forced to practice it. A child could have
    seen through her.</p>
<p>But it was also clear that she had no intention of telling me anything
    further. Whatever the mystery centering around Ursula Bourne might be,
    I was not going to learn it through Mrs. Folliott.</p>
<p>Defeated, I apologized once more for disturbing her, took my hat and
    departed.</p>
<p>I went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o’clock.
    Caroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things. She had that
    look of suppressed exultation on her face which I know only too well.
    It is a sure sign with her, of either the getting or the giving of
    information. I wondered which it had been.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a very interesting afternoon,” began Caroline as I dropped
    into my own particular easy chair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> stretched out my feet to the
    inviting blaze in the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Have you?” I asked. “Miss Ganett drop in to tea?”</p>
<p>Miss Ganett is one of the chief of our newsmongers.</p>
<p>“Guess again,” said Caroline with intense complacency.</p>
<p>I guessed several times, working slowly through all the members of
    Caroline’s Intelligence Corps. My sister received each guess with
    a triumphant shake of the head. In the end she volunteered the
    information herself.</p>
<p>“M. Poirot!” she said. “Now what do you think of that?”</p>
<p>I thought a good many things of it, but I was careful not to say them
    to Caroline.</p>
<p>“Why did he come?” I asked.</p>
<p>“To see me, of course. He said that knowing my brother so well, he
    hoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming
    sister—your charming sister, I’ve got mixed up, but you know what I
    mean.”</p>
<p>“What did he talk about?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He told me a lot about himself and his cases. You know that Prince
    Paul of Mauretania—the one who’s just married a dancer?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in Society Snippets the
    other day, hinting that she was really a Russian Grand Duchess—one
    of the Czar’s daughters who managed to escape from the Bolsheviks.
    Well, it seems that M. Poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that
    threatened to involve them both. Prince Paul was beside himself with
    gratitude.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>
<p>“Did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover’s egg?” I
    inquired sarcastically.</p>
<p>“He didn’t mention it. Why?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I said. “I thought it was always done. It is in detective
    fiction anyway. The super detective always has his rooms littered with
    rubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful Royal clients.”</p>
<p>“It’s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside,”
    said my sister complacently.</p>
<p>It would be—to Caroline. I could not but admire the ingenuity of M.
    Hercule Poirot, who had selected unerringly the case of all others that
    would most appeal to an elderly maiden lady living in a small village.</p>
<p>“Did he tell you if the dancer was really a Grand Duchess?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“He was not at liberty to speak,” said Caroline importantly.</p>
<p>I wondered how far Poirot had strained the truth in talking to
    Caroline—probably not at all. He had conveyed his innuendoes by means
    of his eyebrows and his shoulders.</p>
<p>“And after all this,” I remarked, “I suppose you were ready to eat out
    of his hand.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be coarse, James. I don’t know where you get these vulgar
    expressions from.”</p>
<p>“Probably from my only link with the outside world—my patients.
    Unfortunately my practice does not lie amongst Royal princes and
    interesting Russian émigrés.”</p>
<p>Caroline pushed her spectacles up and looked at me.</p>
<p>“You seem very grumpy, James. It must be your liver. A blue pill, I
    think, to-night.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>
<p>To see me in my own home, you would never imagine that I was a doctor
    of medicine. Caroline does the home prescribing both for herself and me.</p>
<p>“Damn my liver,” I said irritably. “Did you talk about the murder at
    all?”</p>
<p>“Well, naturally, James. What else is there to talk about locally?
    I was able to set M. Poirot right upon several points. He was very
    grateful to me. He said I had the makings of a born detective in me—and
    a wonderful psychological insight into human nature.”</p>
<p>Caroline was exactly like a cat that is full to overflowing with rich
    cream. She was positively purring.</p>
<p>“He talked a lot about the little gray cells of the brain, and of their
    functions. His own, he says, are of the first quality.”</p>
<p>“He would say so,” I remarked bitterly. “Modesty is certainly not his
    middle name.”</p>
<p>“I wish you would not be so horribly American, James. He thought it
    very important that Ralph should be found as soon as possible, and
    induced to come forward and give an account of himself. He says that
    his disappearance will produce a very unfortunate impression at the
    inquest.”</p>
<p>“And what did you say to that?”</p>
<p>“I agreed with him,” said Caroline importantly. “And I was able to tell
    him the way people were already talking about it.”</p>
<p>“Caroline,” I said sharply, “did you tell M. Poirot what you overheard
    in the wood that day?”</p>
<p>“I did,” said Caroline complacently.</p>
<p>I got up and began to walk about.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>
<p>“You realize what you’re doing, I hope,” I jerked out. “You’re putting
    a halter round Ralph Paton’s neck as surely as you’re sitting in that
    chair.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Caroline, quite unruffled. “I was surprised
    <em>you</em> hadn’t told him.”</p>
<p>“I took very good care not to,” I said. “I’m fond of that boy.”</p>
<p>“So am I. That’s why I say you’re talking nonsense. I don’t believe
    Ralph did it, and so the truth can’t hurt him, and we ought to give M.
    Poirot all the help we can. Why, think, very likely Ralph was out with
    that identical girl on the night of the murder, and if so, he’s got a
    perfect alibi.”</p>
<p>“If he’s got a perfect alibi,” I retorted, “why doesn’t he come forward
    and say so?”</p>
<p>“Might get the girl into trouble,” said Caroline sapiently. “But if M.
    Poirot gets hold of her, and puts it to her as her duty, she’ll come
    forward of her own accord and clear Ralph.”</p>
<p>“You seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own,” I said.
    “You read too many trashy novels, Caroline. I’ve always told you so.”</p>
<p>I dropped into my chair again.</p>
<p>“Did Poirot ask you any more questions?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Only about the patients you had that morning.”</p>
<p>“The patients?” I demanded, unbelievingly.</p>
<p>“Yes, your surgery patients. How many and who they were?”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you were able to tell him that?” I demanded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>
<p>Caroline is really amazing.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked my sister triumphantly. “I can see the path up to the
    surgery door perfectly from this window. And I’ve got an excellent
    memory, James. Much better than yours, let me tell you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you have,” I murmured mechanically.</p>
<p>My sister went on, checking the names on her fingers.</p>
<p>“There was old Mrs. Bennett, and that boy from the farm with the bad
    finger, Dolly Grice to have a needle out of her finger; that American
    steward off the liner. Let me see—that’s four. Yes, and old George
    Evans with his ulcer. And lastly——”</p>
<p>She paused significantly.</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>Caroline brought out her climax triumphantly. She hissed in the most
    approved style—aided by the fortunate number of s’s at her disposal.</p>
<p>“<em>Miss Russell!</em>”</p>
<p>She sat back in her chair and looked at me meaningly, and when Caroline
    looks at you meaningly, it is impossible to miss it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” I said, quite untruthfully. “Why
    shouldn’t Miss Russell consult me about her bad knee?”</p>
<p>“Bad knee,” said Caroline. “Fiddlesticks! No more bad knee than you and
    I. She was after something else.”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>Caroline had to admit that she didn’t know.</p>
<p>“But depend upon it, that was what he was trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> get at, M. Poirot,
    I mean. There’s something fishy about that woman, and he knows it.”</p>
<p>“Precisely the remark Mrs. Ackroyd made to me yesterday,” I said. “That
    there was something fishy about Miss Russell.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Caroline darkly, “Mrs. Ackroyd! There’s another!”</p>
<p>“Another what?”</p>
<p>Caroline refused to explain her remarks. She merely nodded her head
    several times, rolled up her knitting, and went upstairs to don the
    high mauve silk blouse and the gold locket which she calls dressing for
    dinner.</p>
<p>I stayed there staring into the fire and thinking over Caroline’s
    words. Had Poirot really come to gain information about Miss Russell,
    or was it only Caroline’s tortuous mind that interpreted everything
    according to her own ideas?</p>
<p>There had certainly been nothing in Miss Russell’s manner that morning
    to arouse suspicion. At least——</p>
<p>I remembered her persistent conversation on the subject of drug-taking
    and from that she had led the conversation to poisons and poisoning.
    But there was nothing in that. Ackroyd had not been poisoned. Still, it
    was odd....</p>
<p>I heard Caroline’s voice, rather acid in note, calling from the top of
    the stairs.</p>
<p>“James, you will be late for dinner.”</p>
<p>I put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently.</p>
<p>It is well at any price to have peace in the home.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">ROUND THE TABLE</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A joint</span> inquest was held on Monday.</p>
<p>I do not propose to give the proceedings in detail. To do so would only
    be to go over the same ground again and again. By arrangement with the
    police, very little was allowed to come out. I gave evidence as to the
    cause of Ackroyd’s death and the probable time. The absence of Ralph
    Paton was commented on by the coroner, but not unduly stressed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Poirot and I had a few words with Inspector Raglan. The
    inspector was very grave.</p>
<p>“It looks bad, Mr. Poirot,” he said. “I’m trying to judge the thing
    fair and square. I’m a local man, and I’ve seen Captain Paton many
    times in Cranchester. I’m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it’s
    bad whichever way you look at it. If he’s innocent, why doesn’t he come
    forward? We’ve got evidence against him, but it’s just possible that
    that evidence could be explained away. Then why doesn’t he give an
    explanation?”</p>
<p>A lot more lay behind the inspector’s words than I knew at the time.
    Ralph’s description had been wired to every port and railway station
    in England. The police everywhere were on the alert. His rooms in town
    were watched, and any houses he had been known to be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> the habit of
    frequenting. With such a <em>cordon</em> it seemed impossible that Ralph
    should be able to evade detection. He had no luggage, and, as far as
    any one knew, no money.</p>
<p>“I can’t find any one who saw him at the station that night,” continued
    the inspector. “And yet he’s well known down here, and you’d think
    somebody would have noticed him. There’s no news from Liverpool either.”</p>
<p>“You think he went to Liverpool?” queried Poirot.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s on the cards. That telephone message from the station,
    just three minutes before the Liverpool express left—there ought to be
    something in that.”</p>
<p>“Unless it was deliberately intended to throw you off the scent. That
    might just possibly be the point of the telephone message.”</p>
<p>“That’s an idea,” said the inspector eagerly. “Do you really think
    that’s the explanation of the telephone call?”</p>
<p>“My friend,” said Poirot gravely, “I do not know. But I will tell you
    this: I believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone
    call we shall find the explanation of the murder.”</p>
<p>“You said something like that before, I remember,” I observed, looking
    at him curiously.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“I always come back to it,” he said seriously.</p>
<p>“It seems to me utterly irrelevant,” I declared.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say that,” demurred the inspector. “But I must confess I
    think Mr. Poirot here harps on it a little too much. We’ve better clews
    than that. The fingerprints on the dagger, for instance.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>
<p>Poirot became suddenly very foreign in manner, as he often did when
    excited over anything.</p>
<p>“M. l’Inspecteur,” he said, “beware of the blind—the blind—<i lang="fr">comment
    dire?</i>—the little street that has no end to it.”</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan stared, but I was quicker.</p>
<p>“You mean a blind alley?” I said.</p>
<p>“That is it—the blind street that leads nowhere. So it may be with
    those fingerprints—they may lead you nowhere.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how that can well be,” said the police officer. “I suppose
    you’re hinting that they’re faked? I’ve read of such things being done,
    though I can’t say I’ve ever come across it in my experience. But fake
    or true—they’re bound to lead <em>somewhere</em>.”</p>
<p>Poirot merely shrugged his shoulders, flinging out his arms wide.</p>
<p>The inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the
    fingerprints, and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops
    and whorls.</p>
<p>“Come now,” he said at last, annoyed by Poirot’s detached manner,
    “you’ve got to admit that those prints were made by some one who was in
    the house that night?”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Bien entendu</i>,” said Poirot, nodding his head.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve taken the prints of every member of the household, every
    one, mind you, from the old lady down to the kitchenmaid.”</p>
<p>I don’t think Mrs. Ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old
    lady. She must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>
<p>“Every one’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.</p>
<p>“Including mine,” I said dryly.</p>
<p>“Very well. None of them correspond. That leaves us two alternatives.
    Ralph Paton, or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about.
    When we get hold of those two——”</p>
<p>“Much valuable time may have been lost,” broke in Poirot.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite get you, Mr. Poirot?”</p>
<p>“You have taken the prints of every one in the house, you say,”
    murmured Poirot. “Is that the exact truth you are telling me there, M.
    l’Inspecteur?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“Without overlooking any one?”</p>
<p>“Without overlooking any one.”</p>
<p>“The quick or the dead?”</p>
<p>For a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a
    religious observation. Then he reacted slowly.</p>
<p>“You mean——”</p>
<p>“The dead, M. l’Inspecteur.”</p>
<p>The inspector still took a minute or two to understand.</p>
<p>“I am suggesting,” said Poirot placidly, “that the fingerprints on the
    dagger handle are those of Mr. Ackroyd himself. It is an easy matter to
    verify. His body is still available.”</p>
<p>“But why? What would be the point of it? You’re surely not suggesting
    suicide, Mr. Poirot?”</p>
<p>“Ah! no. My theory is that the murderer wore gloves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> or wrapped
    something round his hand. After the blow was struck, he picked up the
    victim’s hand and closed it round the dagger handle.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>Poirot shrugged his shoulders again.</p>
<p>“To make a confusing case even more confusing.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said the inspector, “I’ll look into it. What gave you the idea
    in the first place?”</p>
<p>“When you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention to
    the fingerprints. I know very little of loops and whorls—see, I confess
    my ignorance frankly. But it did occur to me that the position of the
    prints was somewhat awkward. Not so would I have held a dagger in order
    to strike. Naturally, with the right hand brought up over the shoulder
    backwards, it would have been difficult to put it in exactly the right
    position.”</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan stared at the little man. Poirot, with an air of great
    unconcern, flecked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the inspector, “it’s an idea. I’ll look into it all right,
    but don’t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it.”</p>
<p>He endeavored to make his tone kindly and patronizing. Poirot watched
    him go off. Then he turned to me with twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>“Another time,” he observed, “I must be more careful of his <i lang="fr">amour
    propre</i>. And now that we are left to our own devices, what do you
    think, my good friend, of a little reunion of the family?”</p>
<p>The “little reunion,” as Poirot called it, took place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> about half an
    hour later. We sat round the table in the dining-room at Fernly—Poirot
    at the head of the table, like the chairman of some ghastly board
    meeting. The servants were not present, so we were six in all. Mrs.
    Ackroyd, Flora, Major Blunt, young Raymond, Poirot, and myself.</p>
<p>When every one was assembled, Poirot rose and bowed.</p>
<p>“Messieurs, mesdames, I have called you together for a certain
    purpose.” He paused. “To begin with, I want to make a very special plea
    to mademoiselle.”</p>
<p>“To me?” said Flora.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, you are engaged to Captain Ralph Paton. If any one
    is in his confidence, you are. I beg you, most earnestly, if you
    know of his whereabouts, to persuade him to come forward. One little
    minute”—as Flora raised her head to speak—“say nothing till you have
    well reflected. Mademoiselle, his position grows daily more dangerous.
    If he had come forward at once, no matter how damning the facts, he
    might have had a chance of explaining them away. But this silence—this
    flight—what can it mean? Surely only one thing, knowledge of guilt.
    Mademoiselle, if you really believe in his innocence, persuade him to
    come forward before it is too late.”</p>
<p>Flora’s face had gone very white.</p>
<p>“Too late!” she repeated, very low.</p>
<p>Poirot leant forward, looking at her.</p>
<p>“See now, mademoiselle,” he said very gently, “it is Papa Poirot who
    asks you this. The old Papa Poirot who has much knowledge and much
    experience. I would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> seek to entrap you, mademoiselle. Will you not
    trust me—and tell me where Ralph Paton is hiding?”</p>
<p>The girl rose, and stood facing him.</p>
<p>“M. Poirot,” she said in a clear voice, “I swear to you—swear
    solemnly—that I have no idea where Ralph is, and that I have neither
    seen him nor heard from him either on the day of—of the murder, or
    since.”</p>
<p>She sat down again. Poirot gazed at her in silence for a minute or two,
    then he brought his hand down on the table with a sharp rap.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Bien!</i> That is that,” he said. His face hardened. “Now I appeal
    to these others who sit round this table, Mrs. Ackroyd, Major Blunt,
    Dr. Sheppard, Mr. Raymond. You are all friends and intimates of the
    missing man. If you know where Ralph Paton is hiding, speak out.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence. Poirot looked to each in turn.</p>
<p>“I beg of you,” he said in a low voice, “speak out.”</p>
<p>But still there was silence, broken at last by Mrs. Ackroyd.</p>
<p>“I must say,” she observed in a plaintive voice, “that Ralph’s absence
    is most peculiar—most peculiar indeed. Not to come forward at such a
    time. It looks, you know, as though there were something <em>behind</em>
    it. I can’t help thinking, Flora dear, that it was a very fortunate
    thing your engagement was never formally announced.”</p>
<p>“Mother!” cried Flora angrily.</p>
<p>“Providence,” declared Mrs. Ackroyd. “I have a devout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> belief in
    Providence—a divinity that shapes our ends, as Shakespeare’s beautiful
    line runs.”</p>
<p>“Surely you don’t make the Almighty directly responsible for
    thick ankles, Mrs. Ackroyd, do you?” asked Geoffrey Raymond, his
    irresponsible laugh ringing out.</p>
<p>His idea was, I think, to loosen the tension, but Mrs. Ackroyd threw
    him a glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Flora has been saved a terrible amount of notoriety and
    unpleasantness. Not for a moment that I think dear Ralph had anything
    to do with poor Roger’s death. I <em>don’t</em> think so. But then I have
    a trusting heart—I always have had, ever since a child. I am loath to
    believe the worst of any one. But, of course, one must remember that
    Ralph was in several air raids as a young boy. The results are apparent
    long after, sometimes, they say. People are not responsible for their
    actions in the least. They lose control, you know, without being able
    to help it.”</p>
<p>“Mother,” cried Flora, “you don’t think Ralph did it?”</p>
<p>“Come, Mrs. Ackroyd,” said Blunt.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to think,” said Mrs. Ackroyd tearfully. “It’s all
    very upsetting. What would happen to the estate, I wonder, if Ralph
    were found guilty?”</p>
<p>Raymond pushed his chair away from the table violently. Major Blunt
    remained very quiet, looking thoughtfully at her. “Like shell-shock,
    you know,” said Mrs. Ackroyd obstinately, “and I dare say Roger kept
    him very short of money—with the best intentions, of course. I can see
    you are all against me, but I do think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> it is very odd that Ralph has
    not come forward, and I must say I am thankful Flora’s engagement was
    never announced formally.”</p>
<p>“It will be to-morrow,” said Flora in a clear voice.</p>
<p>“Flora!” cried her mother, aghast.</p>
<p>Flora had turned to the secretary.</p>
<p>“Will you send the announcement to the <cite>Morning Post</cite> and the
    <cite>Times</cite>, please, Mr. Raymond.”</p>
<p>“If you are sure that it is wise, Miss Ackroyd,” he replied gravely.</p>
<p>She turned impulsively to Blunt.</p>
<p>“You understand,” she said. “What else can I do? As things are, I must
    stand by Ralph. Don’t you see that I must?”</p>
<p>She looked very searchingly at him, and after a long pause he nodded
    abruptly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd burst out into shrill protests. Flora remained unmoved.
    Then Raymond spoke.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your motives, Miss Ackroyd. But don’t you think you’re
    being rather precipitate? Wait a day or two.”</p>
<p>“To-morrow,” said Flora, in a clear voice. “It’s no good, mother, going
    on like this. Whatever else I am, I’m not disloyal to my friends.”</p>
<p>“M. Poirot,” Mrs. Ackroyd appealed tearfully, “can’t you say anything
    at all?”</p>
<p>“Nothing to be said,” interpolated Blunt. “She’s doing the right thing.
    I’ll stand by her through thick and thin.”</p>
<p>Flora held out her hand to him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>
<p>“Thank you, Major Blunt,” she said.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, “will you let an old man congratulate you
    on your courage and your loyalty? And will you not misunderstand me if
    I ask you—ask you most solemnly—to postpone the announcement you speak
    of for at least two days more?”</p>
<p>Flora hesitated.</p>
<p>“I ask it in Ralph Paton’s interests as much as in yours, mademoiselle.
    You frown. You do not see how that can be. But I assure you that it is
    so. <i lang="fr">Pas de blagues</i>. You put the case into my hands—you must not
    hamper me now.”</p>
<p>Flora paused a few minutes before replying.</p>
<p>“I do not like it,” she said at last, “but I will do what you say.”</p>
<p>She sat down again at the table.</p>
<p>“And now, messieurs et mesdames,” said Poirot rapidly, “I will continue
    with what I was about to say. Understand this, I mean to arrive at
    the truth. The truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and
    beautiful to the seeker after it. I am much aged, my powers may not
    be what they were.” Here he clearly expected a contradiction. “In all
    probability this is the last case I shall ever investigate. But Hercule
    Poirot does not end with a failure. Messieurs et mesdames, I tell you,
    I mean to <em>know</em>. And I shall know—in spite of you all.”</p>
<p>He brought out the last words provocatively, hurling them in our face
    as it were. I think we all flinched back a little, excepting Geoffrey
    Raymond, who remained good humored and imperturbable as usual.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>
<p>“How do you mean—in spite of us all?” he asked, with slightly raised
    eyebrows.</p>
<p>“But—just that, monsieur. Every one of you in this room is concealing
    something from me.” He raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest
    arose. “Yes, yes, I know what I am saying. It may be something
    unimportant—trivial—which is supposed to have no bearing on the case,
    but there it is. <em>Each one of you has something to hide.</em> Come,
    now, am I right?”</p>
<p>His glance, challenging and accusing, swept round the table. And every
    pair of eyes dropped before his. Yes, mine as well.</p>
<p>“I am answered,” said Poirot, with a curious laugh. He got up from his
    seat. “I appeal to you all. Tell me the truth—the whole truth.” There
    was a silence. “Will no one speak?”</p>
<p>He gave the same short laugh again.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">C’est dommage</i>,” he said, and went out.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">THE GOOSE QUILL</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> evening, at Poirot’s request, I went over to his house after
    dinner. Caroline saw me depart with visible reluctance. I think she
    would have liked to have accompanied me.</p>
<p>Poirot greeted me hospitably. He had placed a bottle of Irish whisky
    (which I detest) on a small table, with a soda water siphon and a
    glass. He himself was engaged in brewing hot chocolate. It was a
    favorite beverage of his, I discovered later.</p>
<p>He inquired politely after my sister, whom he declared to be a most
    interesting woman.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been giving her a swelled head,” I said dryly. “What
    about Sunday afternoon?”</p>
<p>He laughed and twinkled.</p>
<p>“I always like to employ the expert,” he remarked obscurely, but he
    refused to explain the remark.</p>
<p>“You got all the local gossip anyway,” I remarked. “True, and untrue.”</p>
<p>“And a great deal of valuable information,” he added quietly.</p>
<p>“Such as——?”</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Why not have told me the truth?” he countered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> “In a place like this,
    all Ralph Paton’s doings were bound to be known. If your sister had not
    happened to pass through the wood that day somebody else would have
    done so.”</p>
<p>“I suppose they would,” I said grumpily. “What about this interest of
    yours in my patients?”</p>
<p>Again he twinkled.</p>
<p>“Only one of them, doctor. Only one of them.”</p>
<p>“The last?” I hazarded.</p>
<p>“I find Miss Russell a study of the most interesting,” he said
    evasively.</p>
<p>“Do you agree with my sister and Mrs. Ackroyd that there is something
    fishy about her?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Eh? What do you say—fishy?”</p>
<p>I explained to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>“And they say that, do they?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t my sister convey as much to you yesterday afternoon?”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">C’est possible.</i>”</p>
<p>“For no reason whatever,” I declared.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Les femmes</i>,” generalized Poirot. “They are marvelous! They
    invent haphazard—and by miracle they are right. Not that it is that,
    really. Women observe subconsciously a thousand little details, without
    knowing that they are doing so. Their subconscious mind adds these
    little things together—and they call the result intuition. Me, I am
    very skilled in psychology. I know these things.”</p>
<p>He swelled his chest out importantly, looking so ridiculous, that I
    found it difficult not to burst out laughing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> Then he took a small sip
    of his chocolate, and carefully wiped his mustache.</p>
<p>“I wish you’d tell me,” I burst out, “what you really think of it all?”</p>
<p>He put down his cup.</p>
<p>“You wish that?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“You have seen what I have seen. Should not our ideas be the same?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’re laughing at me,” I said stiffly. “Of course, I’ve no
    experience of matters of this kind.”</p>
<p>Poirot smiled at me indulgently.</p>
<p>“You are like the little child who wants to know the way the engine
    works. You wish to see the affair, not as the family doctor sees it,
    but with the eye of a detective who knows and cares for no one—to whom
    they are all strangers and all equally liable to suspicion.”</p>
<p>“You put it very well,” I said.</p>
<p>“So I give you then, a little lecture. The first thing is to get a
    clear history of what happened that evening—always bearing in mind that
    the person who speaks may be lying.”</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Rather a suspicious attitude.”</p>
<p>“But necessary—I assure you, necessary. Now first—Dr. Sheppard leaves
    the house at ten minutes to nine. How do I know that?”</p>
<p>“Because I told you so.”</p>
<p>“But you might not be speaking the truth—or the watch you went by might
    be wrong. But Parker also says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> that you left the house at ten minutes
    to nine. So we accept that statement and pass on. At nine o’clock you
    run into a man—and here we come to what we will call the Romance of the
    Mysterious Stranger—just outside the Park gates. How do I know that
    that is so?”</p>
<p>“I told you so,” I began again, but Poirot interrupted me with a
    gesture of impatience.</p>
<p>“Ah! but it is that you are a little stupid to-night, my friend.
    <em>You</em> know that it is so—but how am <em>I</em> to know? <i lang="fr">Eh
    bien</i>, I am able to tell you that the Mysterious Stranger was not
    a hallucination on your part, because the maid of a Miss Ganett met
    him a few minutes before you did, and of her too he inquired the way
    to Fernly Park. We accept his presence, therefore, and we can be
    fairly sure of two things about him—that he was a stranger to the
    neighborhood, and that whatever his object in going to Fernly, there
    was no great secrecy about it, since he twice asked the way there.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “I see that.”</p>
<p>“Now I have made it my business to find out more about this man. He had
    a drink at the Three Boars, I learn, and the barmaid there says that he
    spoke with an American accent and mentioned having just come over from
    the States. Did it strike you that he had an American accent?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think he had,” I said, after a minute or two, during which I
    cast my mind back; “but a very slight one.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Précisément.</i> There is also this which, you will remember, I
    picked up in the summer-house?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>
<p>He held out to me the little quill. I looked at it curiously. Then a
    memory of something I had read stirred in me.</p>
<p>Poirot, who had been watching my face, nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, heroin ‘snow.’ Drug-takers carry it like this, and sniff it up
    the nose.”</p>
<p>“Diamorphine hydrochloride,” I murmured mechanically.</p>
<p>“This method of taking the drug is very common on the other side.
    Another proof, if we wanted one, that the man came from Canada or the
    States.”</p>
<p>“What first attracted your attention to that summer-house?” I asked
    curiously.</p>
<p>“My friend the inspector took it for granted that any one using that
    path did so as a short cut to the house, but as soon as I saw the
    summer-house, I realized that the same path would be taken by any one
    using the summer-house as a rendezvous. Now it seems fairly certain
    that the stranger came neither to the front nor to the back door. Then
    did some one from the house go out and meet him? If so, what could be a
    more convenient place than that little summer-house? I searched it with
    the hope that I might find some clew inside. I found two, the scrap of
    cambric and the quill.”</p>
<p>“And the scrap of cambric?” I asked curiously. “What about that?”</p>
<p>Poirot raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“You do not use your little gray cells,” he remarked dryly. “The scrap
    of starched cambric should be obvious.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>
<p>“Not very obvious to me.” I changed the subject. “Anyway,” I said,
    “this man went to the summer-house to meet somebody. Who was that
    somebody?”</p>
<p>“Exactly the question,” said Poirot. “You will remember that Mrs.
    Ackroyd and her daughter came over from Canada to live here?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you meant to-day when you accused them of hiding the
    truth?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. Now another point. What did you think of the parlormaid’s
    story?”</p>
<p>“What story?”</p>
<p>“The story of her dismissal. Does it take half an hour to dismiss a
    servant? Was the story of those important papers a likely one? And
    remember, though she says she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until
    ten o’clock, there is no one to confirm her statement.”</p>
<p>“You bewilder me,” I said.</p>
<p>“To me it grows clearer. But tell me now your own ideas and theories.”</p>
<p>I drew a piece of paper from my pocket.</p>
<p>“I just scribbled down a few suggestions,” I said apologetically.</p>
<p>“But excellent—you have method. Let us hear them.”</p>
<p>I read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice.</p>
<p>“To begin with, one must look at the thing logically——”</p>
<p>“Just what my poor Hastings used to say,” interrupted Poirot, “but
    alas! he never did so.”</p>
<p>“<em>Point <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 1.</em>—Mr. Ackroyd was heard talking to some one at
    half-past nine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>
<p>“<em>Point <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 2.</em>—At some time during the evening Ralph Paton must
    have come in through the window, as evidenced by the prints of his
    shoes.</p>
<p>“<em>Point <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 3.</em>—Mr. Ackroyd was nervous that evening, and would
    only have admitted some one he knew.</p>
<p>“<em>Point <abbr title="number">No.</abbr> 4.</em>—The person with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty was
    asking for money. We know Ralph Paton was in a scrape.</p>
<p>“<em>These four points go to show that the person with Mr. Ackroyd at
    nine-thirty was Ralph Paton. But we know that Mr. Ackroyd was alive at
    a quarter to ten, therefore it was not Ralph who killed him. Ralph left
    the window open. Afterwards the murderer came in that way.</em>”</p>
<p>“And who was the murderer?” inquired Poirot.</p>
<p>“The American stranger. He may have been in league with Parker, and
    possibly in Parker we have the man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. If
    so, Parker may have heard enough to realize the game was up, have told
    his accomplice so, and the latter did the crime with the dagger which
    Parker gave him.”</p>
<p>“It is a theory that,” admitted Poirot. “Decidedly you have cells of a
    kind. But it leaves a good deal unaccounted for.”</p>
<p>“Such as——?”</p>
<p>“The telephone call, the pushed-out chair——”</p>
<p>“Do you really think the latter important?” I interrupted.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not,” admitted my friend. “It may have been pulled out
    by accident, and Raymond or Blunt may have shoved it into place
    unconsciously under the stress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> of emotion. Then there is the missing
    forty pounds.”</p>
<p>“Given by Ackroyd to Ralph,” I suggested. “He may have reconsidered his
    first refusal.”</p>
<p>“That still leaves one thing unexplained?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Why was Blunt so certain in his own mind that it was Raymond with Mr.
    Ackroyd at nine-thirty?”</p>
<p>“He explained that,” I said.</p>
<p>“You think so? I will not press the point. Tell me instead, what were
    Ralph Paton’s reasons for disappearing?”</p>
<p>“That’s rather more difficult,” I said slowly. “I shall have to speak
    as a medical man. Ralph’s nerves must have gone phut! If he suddenly
    found out that his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his
    leaving him—after, perhaps, a rather stormy interview—well, he might
    get the wind up and clear right out. Men have been known to do that—act
    guiltily when they’re perfectly innocent.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is true,” said Poirot. “But we must not lose sight of one
    thing.”</p>
<p>“I know what you’re going to say,” I remarked: “motive. Ralph Paton
    inherits a great fortune by his uncle’s death.”</p>
<p>“That is one motive,” agreed Poirot.</p>
<p>“One?”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Mais oui.</i> Do you realize that there are three separate motives
    staring us in the face. Somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and
    its contents. That is one motive. Blackmail! Ralph Paton may have been
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Remember, as far as Hammond
    knew, Ralph Paton had not applied to his uncle for help of late. That
    looks as though he were being supplied with money elsewhere. Then there
    is the fact that he was in some—how do you say—scrape?—which he feared
    might get to his uncle’s ears. And finally there is the one you have
    just mentioned.”</p>
<p>“Dear me,” I said, rather taken aback. “The case does seem black
    against him.”</p>
<p>“Does it?” said Poirot. “That is where we disagree, you and I. Three
    motives—it is almost too much. I am inclined to believe that, after
    all, Ralph Paton is innocent.”</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">MRS. ACKROYD</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> the evening talk I have just chronicled, the affair seemed to
    me to enter on a different phase. The whole thing can be divided into
    two parts, each clear and distinct from the other. Part I. ranges from
    Ackroyd’s death on the Friday evening to the following Monday night.
    It is the straight-forward narrative of what occurred, as presented
    to Hercule Poirot. I was at Poirot’s elbow the whole time. I saw what
    he saw. I tried my best to read his mind. As I know now, I failed in
    this latter task. Though Poirot showed me all his discoveries—as, for
    instance, the gold wedding-ring—he held back the vital and yet logical
    impressions that he formed. As I came to know later, this secrecy was
    characteristic of him. He would throw out hints and suggestions, but
    beyond that he would not go.</p>
<p>As I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that
    of Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday
    our ways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear
    of what he was doing, because, in King’s Abbot, you get to hear of
    everything, but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand. And
    I, too, had my own preoccupations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>
<p>On looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal
    character of this period. Every one had a hand in the elucidation of
    the mystery. It was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which every one
    contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their
    task ended there. To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those
    pieces into their correct place.</p>
<p>Some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning.
    There was, for instance, the question of the black boots. But that
    comes later.... To take things strictly in chronological order, I must
    begin with the summons from Mrs. Ackroyd.</p>
<p>She sent for me early on Tuesday morning, and since the summons
    sounded an urgent one, I hastened there, expecting to find her <i lang="la">in
    extremis</i>.</p>
<p>The lady was in bed. So much did she concede to the etiquette of the
    situation. She gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to
    the bedside.</p>
<p>“Well, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “and what’s the matter with you?”</p>
<p>I spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected
    of general practitioners.</p>
<p>“I’m prostrated,” said Mrs. Ackroyd in a faint voice. “Absolutely
    prostrated. It’s the shock of poor Roger’s death. They say these things
    often aren’t felt at the <em>time</em>, you know. It’s the reaction
    afterwards.”</p>
<p>It is a pity that a doctor is precluded by his profession from being
    able sometimes to say what he really thinks.</p>
<p>I would have given anything to be able to answer “Bunkum!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>
<p>Instead, I suggested a tonic. Mrs. Ackroyd accepted the tonic. One
    move in the game seemed now to be concluded. Not for a moment did I
    imagine that I had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by
    Ackroyd’s death. But Mrs. Ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing
    a straight-forward course on any subject. She always approaches her
    object by tortuous means. I wondered very much why it was she had sent
    for me.</p>
<p>“And then that scene—yesterday,” continued my patient.</p>
<p>She paused as though expecting me to take up a cue.</p>
<p>“What scene?”</p>
<p>“Doctor, how can you? Have you forgotten? That dreadful little
    Frenchman—or Belgian—or whatever he is. Bullying us all like he did. It
    has quite upset me. Coming on top of Roger’s death.”</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what he meant—shouting at us like he did. I should hope
    I know my duty too well to <em>dream</em> of concealing anything. I have
    given the police <em>every</em> assistance in my power.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd paused, and I said, “Quite so.” I was beginning to have a
    glimmering of what all the trouble was about.</p>
<p>“No one can say that I have failed in my duty,” continued Mrs. Ackroyd.
    “I am sure Inspector Raglan is perfectly satisfied. Why should this
    little upstart of a foreigner make a fuss? A most ridiculous-looking
    creature he is too—just like a comic Frenchman in a revue. I can’t
    think why Flora insisted on bringing him into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> case. She never said
    a word to me about it. Just went off and did it on her own. Flora is
    too independent. I am a woman of the world and her mother. She should
    have come to me for advice first.”</p>
<p>I listened to all this in silence.</p>
<p>“What does he think? That’s what I want to know. Does he actually
    imagine I’m hiding something? He—he—positively <em>accused</em> me
    yesterday.”</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>“It is surely of no consequence, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said. “Since you are
    not concealing anything, any remarks he may have made do not apply to
    you.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd went off at a tangent, after her usual fashion.</p>
<p>“Servants are so tiresome,” she said. “They gossip, and talk amongst
    themselves. And then it gets round—and all the time there’s probably
    nothing in it at all.”</p>
<p>“Have the servants been talking?” I asked. “What about?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd cast a very shrewd glance at me. It quite threw me off my
    balance.</p>
<p>“I was sure <em>you’d</em> know, doctor, if any one did. You were with M.
    Poirot all the time, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I was.”</p>
<p>“Then of course you know. It was that girl, Ursula Bourne, wasn’t it?
    Naturally—she’s leaving. She <em>would</em> want to make all the trouble
    she could. Spiteful, that’s what they are. They’re all alike. Now,
    you being there, doctor, you must know exactly what she did say? I’m
    most anxious that no wrong impression should get about.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> After all,
    you don’t repeat every little detail to the police, do you? There are
    family matters sometimes—nothing to do with the question of the murder.
    But if the girl was spiteful, she may have made out all sorts of
    things.”</p>
<p>I was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these
    outpourings. Poirot had been justified in his premises. Of the six
    people round the table yesterday, Mrs. Ackroyd at least had had
    something to hide. It was for me to discover what that something might
    be.</p>
<p>“If I were you, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brusquely, “I should make a clean
    breast of things.”</p>
<p>She gave a little scream.</p>
<p>“Oh! doctor, how can you be so abrupt. It sounds as though—as
    though——And I can explain everything so simply.”</p>
<p>“Then why not do so,” I suggested.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd took out a frilled handkerchief, and became tearful.</p>
<p>“I thought, doctor, that you might put it to M. Poirot—explain it, you
    know—because it’s so difficult for a foreigner to see our point of
    view. And you don’t know—nobody could know—what I’ve had to contend
    with. A martyrdom—a long martyrdom. That’s what my life has been. I
    don’t like to speak ill of the dead—but there it is. Not the smallest
    bill, but it had all to be gone over—just as though Roger had had a
    few miserly hundreds a year instead of being (as Mr. Hammond told me
    yesterday) one of the wealthiest men in these parts.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd paused to dab her eyes with the frilled handkerchief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” I said encouragingly. “You were talking about bills?”</p>
<p>“Those dreadful bills. And some I didn’t like to show Roger at all.
    They were things a man wouldn’t understand. He would have said the
    things weren’t necessary. And of course they mounted up, you know, and
    they kept coming in——”</p>
<p>She looked at me appealingly, as though asking me to condole with her
    on this striking peculiarity.</p>
<p>“It’s a habit they have,” I agreed.</p>
<p>“And the tone altered—became quite abusive. I assure you, doctor,
    I was becoming a nervous wreck. I couldn’t sleep at nights. And a
    dreadful fluttering round the heart. And then I got a letter from a
    Scotch gentleman—as a matter of fact there were two letters—both Scotch
    gentlemen. Mr. Bruce MacPherson was one, and the other were Colin
    MacDonald. Quite a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Hardly that,” I said dryly. “They are usually Scotch gentlemen, but I
    suspect a Semitic strain in their ancestry.”</p>
<p>“Ten pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone,” murmured Mrs.
    Ackroyd reminiscently. “I wrote to one of them, but it seemed there
    were difficulties.”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p>I gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground. I have never
    known any one more difficult to bring to the point.</p>
<p>“You see,” murmured Mrs. Ackroyd, “it’s all a question of expectations,
    isn’t it? Testamentary expectations. And though, of course, I expected
    that Roger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> would provide for me, I didn’t <em>know</em>. I thought that
    if only I could glance over a copy of his will—not in any sense of
    vulgar prying—but just so that I could make my own arrangements.”</p>
<p>She glanced sideways at me. The position was now very delicate indeed.
    Fortunately words, ingeniously used, will serve to mask the ugliness of
    naked facts.</p>
<p>“I could only tell this to you, dear Dr. Sheppard,” said Mrs. Ackroyd
    rapidly. “I can trust you not to misjudge me, and to represent the
    matter in the right light to M. Poirot. It was on Friday afternoon——”</p>
<p>She came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I repeated encouragingly. “On Friday afternoon. Well?”</p>
<p>“Every one was out, or so I thought. And I went into Roger’s study—I
    had some real reason for going there—I mean, there was nothing
    underhand about it. And as I saw all the papers heaped on the desk, it
    just came to me, like a flash: ‘I wonder if Roger keeps his will in
    one of the drawers of the desk.’ I’m so impulsive, always was, from a
    child. I do things on the spur of the moment. He’d left his keys—very
    careless of him—in the lock of the top drawer.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said helpfully. “So you searched the desk. Did you find the
    will?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd gave a little scream, and I realized that I had not been
    sufficiently diplomatic.</p>
<p>“How dreadful it sounds. But it wasn’t at all like that really.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>
<p>“Of course it wasn’t,” I said hastily. “You must forgive my unfortunate
    way of putting things.”</p>
<p>“You see, men are so peculiar. In dear Roger’s place, I should not
    have objected to revealing the provisions of my will. But men are so
    secretive. One is forced to adopt little subterfuges in self-defence.”</p>
<p>“And the result of the little subterfuge?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s just what I’m telling you. As I got to the bottom drawer,
    Bourne came in. Most awkward. Of course I shut the drawer and stood
    up, and I called her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface.
    But I didn’t like the way she looked—quite respectful in manner, but
    a very nasty light in her eyes. Almost contemptuous, if you know what
    I mean. I never have liked that girl very much. She’s a good servant,
    and she says Ma’am, and doesn’t object to wearing caps and aprons (which
    I declare to you a lot of them do nowadays), and she can say ‘Not at
    home’ without scruples if she has to answer the door instead of Parker,
    and she doesn’t have those peculiar gurgling noises inside which so
    many parlormaids seem to have when they wait at table——Let me see,
    where was I?”</p>
<p>“You were saying, that in spite of several valuable qualities, you
    never liked Bourne.”</p>
<p>“No more I do. She’s—odd. There’s something different about her from
    the others. Too well educated, that’s my opinion. You can’t tell who
    are ladies and who aren’t nowadays.”</p>
<p>“And what happened next?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing. At least, Roger came in. And I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> he was out for a
    walk. And he said: ‘What’s all this?’ and I said, ‘Nothing. I just came
    in to fetch <cite>Punch</cite>.’ And I took <cite>Punch</cite> and went out with
    it. Bourne stayed behind. I heard her asking Roger if she could speak
    to him for a minute. I went straight up to my room, to lie down. I was
    very upset.”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“You will explain to M. Poirot, won’t you? You can see for yourself
    what a trivial matter the whole thing was. But, of course, when he was
    so stern about concealing things, I thought of this at once. Bourne
    may have made some extraordinary story out of it, but you can explain,
    can’t you?”</p>
<p>“That is all?” I said. “You have told me everything?”</p>
<p>“Ye-es,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “Oh! yes,” she added firmly.</p>
<p>But I had noted the momentary hesitation, and I knew that there was
    still something she was keeping back. It was nothing less than a flash
    of sheer genius that prompted me to ask the question I did.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “was it you who left the silver table open?”</p>
<p>I had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could
    not conceal.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“It was you, then?”</p>
<p>“Yes—I—you see—there were one or two pieces of old silver—very
    interesting. I had been reading up the subject and there was an
    illustration of quite a small piece which had fetched an immense
    sum at Christy’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> It looked to me just the same as the one in the
    silver table. I thought I would take it up to London with me when I
    went—and—and have it valued. Then if it really was a valuable piece,
    just think what a charming surprise it would have been for Roger?”</p>
<p>I refrained from comments, accepting Mrs. Ackroyd’s story on its
    merits. I even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what
    she wanted in such a surreptitious manner.</p>
<p>“Why did you leave the lid open?” I asked. “Did you forget?”</p>
<p>“I was startled,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “I heard footsteps coming along
    the terrace outside. I hastened out of the room and just got up the
    stairs before Parker opened the front door to you.”</p>
<p>“That must have been Miss Russell,” I said thoughtfully. Mrs. Ackroyd
    had revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting. Whether her
    designs upon Ackroyd’s silver had been strictly honorable I neither
    knew nor cared. What did interest me was the fact that Miss Russell
    must have entered the drawing-room by the window, and that I had not
    been wrong when I judged her to be out of breath with running. Where
    had she been? I thought of the summer-house and the scrap of cambric.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Miss Russell has her handkerchiefs starched!” I exclaimed
    on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd’s start recalled me to myself, and I rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>
<p>“You think you can explain to M. Poirot?” she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly. Absolutely.”</p>
<p>I got away at last, after being forced to listen to more justifications
    of her conduct.</p>
<p>The parlormaid was in the hall, and it was she who helped me on with my
    overcoat. I observed her more closely than I had done heretofore. It
    was clear that she had been crying.</p>
<p>“How is it,” I asked, “that you told us that Mr. Ackroyd sent for you
    on Friday to his study? I hear now that it was <em>you</em> who asked to
    speak to <em>him</em>?”</p>
<p>For a minute the girl’s eyes dropped before mine.</p>
<p>Then she spoke.</p>
<p>“I meant to leave in any case,” she said uncertainly.</p>
<p>I said no more. She opened the front door for me. Just as I was passing
    out, she said suddenly in a low voice:—</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sir, is there any news of Captain Paton?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, looking at her inquiringly.</p>
<p>“He ought to come back,” she said. “Indeed—indeed he ought to come
    back.”</p>
<p>She was looking at me with appealing eyes.</p>
<p>“Does no one know where he is?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Do you?” I said sharply.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, indeed. I know nothing. But any one who was a friend to him would
    tell him this: he ought to come back.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>
<p>I lingered, thinking that perhaps the girl would say more. Her next
    question surprised me.</p>
<p>“When do they think the murder was done? Just before ten o’clock?”</p>
<p>“That is the idea,” I said. “Between a quarter to ten and the hour.”</p>
<p>“Not earlier? Not before a quarter to ten?”</p>
<p>I looked at her attentively. She was so clearly eager for a reply in
    the affirmative.</p>
<p>“That’s out of the question,” I said. “Miss Ackroyd saw her uncle alive
    at a quarter to ten.”</p>
<p>She turned away, and her whole figure seemed to droop.</p>
<p>“A handsome girl,” I said to myself as I drove off. “An exceedingly
    handsome girl.”</p>
<p>Caroline was at home. She had had a visit from Poirot and was very
    pleased and important about it.</p>
<p>“I am helping him with the case,” she explained.</p>
<p>I felt rather uneasy. Caroline is bad enough as it is. What will she be
    like with her detective instincts encouraged?</p>
<p>“Are you going round the neighborhood looking for Ralph Paton’s
    mysterious girl?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“I might do that on my own account,” said Caroline. “No, this is a
    special thing M. Poirot wants me to find out for him.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He wants to know whether Ralph Paton’s boots were black or brown,”
    said Caroline with tremendous solemnity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>
<p>I stared at her. I see now that I was unbelievably stupid about these
    boots. I failed altogether to grasp the point.</p>
<p>“They were brown shoes,” I said. “I saw them.”</p>
<p>“Not shoes, James, boots. M. Poirot wants to know whether a pair of
    boots Ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black. A lot hangs
    on it.”</p>
<p>Call me dense if you like. I didn’t see.</p>
<p>“And how are you going to find out?” I asked.</p>
<p>Caroline said there would be no difficulty about that. Our Annie’s
    dearest friend was Miss Ganett’s maid, Clara. And Clara was walking
    out with the boots at the Three Boars. The whole thing was simplicity
    itself, and by the aid of Miss Ganett, who coöperated loyally, at once
    giving Clara leave of absence, the matter was rushed through at express
    speed.</p>
<p>It was when we were sitting down to lunch that Caroline remarked, with
    would-be unconcern:—</p>
<p>“About those boots of Ralph Paton’s.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “what about them?”</p>
<p>“M. Poirot thought they were probably brown. He was wrong. They’re
    black.”</p>
<p>And Caroline nodded her head several times. She evidently felt that she
    had scored a point over Poirot.</p>
<p>I did not answer. I was puzzling over what the color of a pair of Ralph
    Paton’s boots had to do with the case.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">GEOFFREY RAYMOND</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I was</span> to have a further proof that day of the success of Poirot’s
    tactics. That challenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his
    knowledge of human nature. A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the
    truth from Mrs. Ackroyd. She was the first to react.</p>
<p>That afternoon when I returned from seeing my patients, Caroline told
    me that Geoffrey Raymond had just left.</p>
<p>“Did he want to see me?” I asked, as I hung up my coat in the hall.</p>
<p>Caroline was hovering by my elbow.</p>
<p>“It was M. Poirot he wanted to see,” she said. “He’d just come from The
    Larches. M. Poirot was out. Mr. Raymond thought that he might be here,
    or that you might know where he was.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the least idea.”</p>
<p>“I tried to make him wait,” said Caroline, “but he said he would call
    back at The Larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. A
    great pity, because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he
    left.”</p>
<p>“Came in here?”</p>
<p>“No, to his own house.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“The side window,” said Caroline briefly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>
<p>It seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic. Caroline thought
    otherwise.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going across?”</p>
<p>“Across where?”</p>
<p>“To The Larches, of course.”</p>
<p>“My dear Caroline,” I said, “what for?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Raymond wanted to see him very particularly,” said Caroline. “You
    might hear what it’s all about.”</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Curiosity is not my besetting sin,” I remarked coldly. “I can exist
    comfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbors are doing and
    thinking.”</p>
<p>“Stuff and nonsense, James,” said my sister. “You want to know just
    as much as I do. You’re not so honest, that’s all. You always have to
    pretend.”</p>
<p>“Really, Caroline,” I said, and retired into my surgery.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Caroline tapped at the door and entered. In her hand
    she held what seemed to be a pot of jam.</p>
<p>“I wonder, James,” she said, “if you would mind taking this pot of
    medlar jelly across to M. Poirot? I promised it to him. He has never
    tasted any home-made medlar jelly.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t Annie go?” I asked coldly.</p>
<p>“She’s doing some mending. I can’t spare her.”</p>
<p>Caroline and I looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Very well,” I said, rising. “But if I take the beastly thing, I shall
    just leave it at the door. You understand that?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>
<p>My sister raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Naturally,” she said. “Who suggested you should do anything else?”</p>
<p>The honors were with Caroline.</p>
<p>“If you <em>do</em> happen to see M. Poirot,” she said, as I opened the
    front door, “you might tell him about the boots.”</p>
<p>It was a most subtle parting shot. I wanted dreadfully to understand
    the enigma of the boots. When the old lady with the Breton cap opened
    the door to me, I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in, quite
    automatically.</p>
<p>Poirot sprang up to meet me, with every appearance of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Sit down, my good friend,” he said. “The big chair? This small one?
    The room is not too hot, no?”</p>
<p>I thought it was stifling, but refrained from saying so. The windows
    were closed, and a large fire burned in the grate.</p>
<p>“The English people, they have a mania for the fresh air,” declared
    Poirot. “The big air, it is all very well outside, where it belongs. Why
    admit it to the house? But let us not discuss such banalities. You have
    something for me, yes?”</p>
<p>“Two things,” I said. “First—this—from my sister.”</p>
<p>I handed over the pot of medlar jelly.</p>
<p>“How kind of Mademoiselle Caroline. She has remembered her promise. And
    the second thing?”</p>
<p>“Information—of a kind.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>
<p>And I told him of my interview with Mrs. Ackroyd. He listened with
    interest, but not much excitement.</p>
<p>“It clears the ground,” he said thoughtfully. “And it has a certain
    value as confirming the evidence of the housekeeper. She said, you
    remember, that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down
    in passing.”</p>
<p>“What about her statement that she went into the drawing-room to see if
    the flowers were fresh?”</p>
<p>“Ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend? It was
    patently an excuse, trumped up in a hurry, by a woman who felt it
    urgent to explain her presence—which, by the way, you would probably
    never have thought of questioning. I considered it possible that her
    agitation might arise from the fact that she had been tampering with
    the silver table, but I think now that we must look for another cause.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Whom did she go out to meet? And why?”</p>
<p>“You think she went to meet some one?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“So do I,” he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“By the way,” I said, “I’ve got a message for you from my sister. Ralph
    Paton’s boots were black, not brown.”</p>
<p>I was watching him closely as I gave the message, and I fancied that
    I saw a momentary flicker of discomposure. If so, it passed almost
    immediately.</p>
<p>“She is absolutely positive they are not brown?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>
<p>“Ah!” said Poirot regretfully. “That is a pity.”</p>
<p>And he seemed quite crestfallen.</p>
<p>He entered into no explanations, but at once started a new subject of
    conversation.</p>
<p>“The housekeeper, Miss Russell, who came to consult you on that Friday
    morning—is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview—apart from
    the medical details, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said. “When the professional part of the conversation
    was over, we talked for a few minutes about poisons, and the ease or
    difficulty of detecting them, and about drug-taking and drug-takers.”</p>
<p>“With special reference to cocaine?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” I asked, somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>For answer, the little man rose and crossed the room to where
    newspapers were filed. He brought me a copy of the <cite>Daily Budget</cite>,
    dated Friday, 16th September, and showed me an article dealing with the
    smuggling of cocaine. It was a somewhat lurid article, written with an
    eye to picturesque effect.</p>
<p>“That is what put cocaine into her head, my friend,” he said.</p>
<p>I would have catechized him further, for I did not quite understand his
    meaning, but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was
    announced.</p>
<p>He came in fresh and debonair as ever, and greeted us both.</p>
<p>“How are you, doctor? M. Poirot, this is the second time I’ve been here
    this morning. I was anxious to catch you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>
<p>“Perhaps I’d better be off,” I suggested rather awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Not on my account, doctor. No, it’s just this,” he went on, seating
    himself at a wave of invitation from Poirot, “I’ve got a confession to
    make.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">En verité</i>?” said Poirot, with an air of polite interest.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s of no consequence, really. But, as a matter of fact, my
    conscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon. You
    accused us all of keeping back something, M. Poirot. I plead guilty.
    I’ve had something up my sleeve.”</p>
<p>“And what is that, M. Raymond?”</p>
<p>“As I say, it’s nothing of consequence—just this. I was in debt—badly,
    and that legacy came in the nick of time. Five hundred pounds puts me
    on my feet again with a little to spare.”</p>
<p>He smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a
    likable youngster.</p>
<p>“You know how it is. Suspicious looking policeman—don’t like to admit
    you were hard up for money—think it will look bad to them. But I was
    a fool, really, because Blunt and I were in the billiard room from a
    quarter to ten onwards, so I’ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to
    fear. Still, when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things,
    I felt a nasty prick of conscience, and I thought I’d like to get it
    off my mind.”</p>
<p>He got up again and stood smiling at us.</p>
<p>“You are a very wise young man,” said Poirot, nodding at him with
    approval. “See you, when I know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> any one is hiding things from me,
    I suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed. You
    have done well.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I’m cleared from suspicion,” laughed Raymond. “I’ll be off
    now.”</p>
<p>“So that is that,” I remarked, as the door closed behind the young
    secretary.</p>
<p>“Yes,” agreed Poirot. “A mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the
    billiard room—who knows? After all, many crimes have been committed for
    the sake of less than five hundred pounds. It all depends on what sum
    is sufficient to break a man. A question of the relativity, is it not
    so? Have you reflected, my friend, that many people in that house stood
    to benefit by Mr. Ackroyd’s death? Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora, young Mr.
    Raymond, the housekeeper, Miss Russell. Only one, in fact, does not,
    Major Blunt.”</p>
<p>His tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that I looked up,
    puzzled.</p>
<p>“I don’t quite understand you?” I said.</p>
<p>“Two of the people I accused have given me the truth.”</p>
<p>“You think Major Blunt has something to conceal also?”</p>
<p>“As for that,” remarked Poirot nonchalantly, “there is a saying, is
    there not, that Englishmen conceal only one thing—their love? And Major
    Blunt, I should say, is not good at concealments.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes,” I said, “I wonder if we haven’t rather jumped to
    conclusions on one point.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>
<p>“We’ve assumed that the blackmailer of Mrs. Ferrars is necessarily the
    murderer of Mr. Ackroyd. Mightn’t we be mistaken?”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded energetically.</p>
<p>“Very good. Very good indeed. I wondered if that idea would come to
    you. Of course it is possible. But we must remember one point. The
    letter disappeared. Still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean
    that the murderer took it. When you first found the body, Parker may
    have abstracted the letter unnoticed by you.”</p>
<p>“Parker?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Parker. I always come back to Parker—not as the murderer—no, he
    did not commit the murder; but who is more suitable than he as the
    mysterious scoundrel who terrorized Mrs. Ferrars? He may have got his
    information about Mr. Ferrars’s death from one of the King’s Paddock
    servants. At any rate, he is more likely to have come upon it than a
    casual guest such as Blunt, for instance.”</p>
<p>“Parker might have taken the letter,” I admitted. “It wasn’t till later
    that I noticed it was gone.”</p>
<p>“How much later? After Blunt and Raymond were in the room, or before?”</p>
<p>“I can’t remember,” I said slowly. “I think it was before—no,
    afterwards. Yes, I’m almost sure it was afterwards.”</p>
<p>“That widens the field to three,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “But Parker
    is the most likely. It is in my mind to try a little experiment with
    Parker. How say you, my friend, will you accompany me to Fernly?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>
<p>I acquiesced, and we set out at once. Poirot asked to see Miss Ackroyd,
    and presently Flora came to us.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle Flora,” said Poirot, “I have to confide in you a little
    secret. I am not yet satisfied of the innocence of Parker. I propose to
    make a little experiment with your assistance. I want to reconstruct
    some of his actions on that night. But we must think of something to
    tell him—ah! I have it. I wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices
    in the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace. Now,
    ring for Parker, if you will be so good.”</p>
<p>I did so, and presently the butler appeared, suave as ever.</p>
<p>“You rang, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my good Parker. I have in mind a little experiment. I have placed
    Major Blunt on the terrace outside the study window. I want to see if
    any one there could have heard the voices of Miss Ackroyd and yourself
    in the lobby that night. I want to enact that little scene over again.
    Perhaps you would fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying?”</p>
<p>Parker vanished, and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door.
    Presently we heard a chink in the outer hall, and Parker appeared in
    the doorway carrying a tray with a siphon, a decanter of whisky, and
    two glasses on it.</p>
<p>“One moment,” cried Poirot, raising his hand and seemingly very
    excited. “We must have everything in order. Just as it occurred. It is
    a little method of mine.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>
<p>“A foreign custom, sir,” said Parker. “Reconstruction of the crime they
    call it, do they not?”</p>
<p>He was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on
    Poirot’s orders.</p>
<p>“Ah! he knows something, the good Parker,” cried Poirot. “He has read
    of these things. Now, I beg you, let us have everything of the most
    exact. You came from the outer hall—so. Mademoiselle was—where?”</p>
<p>“Here,” said Flora, taking up her stand just outside the study door.</p>
<p>“Quite right, sir,” said Parker.</p>
<p>“I had just closed the door,” continued Flora.</p>
<p>“Yes, miss,” agreed Parker. “Your hand was still on the handle as it is
    now.”</p>
<p>“Then <i lang="fr">allez</i>,” said Poirot. “Play me the little comedy.”</p>
<p>Flora stood with her hand on the door handle, and Parker came stepping
    through the door from the hall, bearing the tray.</p>
<p>He stopped just inside the door. Flora spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh! Parker. Mr. Ackroyd doesn’t want to be disturbed again to-night.”</p>
<p>“Is that right?” she added in an undertone.</p>
<p>“To the best of my recollection, Miss Flora,” said Parker, “but I fancy
    you used the word evening instead of night.” Then, raising his voice
    in a somewhat theatrical fashion: “Very good, miss. Shall I lock up as
    usual?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>
<p>Parker retired through the door, Flora followed him, and started to
    ascend the main staircase.</p>
<p>“Is that enough?” she asked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Admirable,” declared the little man, rubbing his hands. “By the way,
    Parker, are you sure there were two glasses on the tray that evening?
    Who was the second one for?”</p>
<p>“I always bring two glasses, sir,” said Parker. “Is there anything
    further?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I thank you.”</p>
<p>Parker withdrew, dignified to the last.</p>
<p>Poirot stood in the middle of the hall frowning. Flora came down and
    joined us.</p>
<p>“Has your experiment been successful?” she asked. “I don’t quite
    understand, you know——”</p>
<p>Poirot smiled admiringly at her.</p>
<p>“It is not necessary that you should,” he said. “But tell me, were
    there indeed two glasses on Parker’s tray that night?”</p>
<p>Flora wrinkled her brows a minute.</p>
<p>“I really can’t remember,” she said. “I think there were. Is—is that
    the object of your experiment?”</p>
<p>Poirot took her hand and patted it.</p>
<p>“Put it this way,” he said. “I am always interested to see if people
    will speak the truth.”</p>
<p>“And did Parker speak the truth?”</p>
<p>“I rather think he did,” said Poirot thoughtfully.</p>
<p>A few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>
<p>“What was the point of that question about the glasses?” I asked
    curiously.</p>
<p>Poirot shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“One must say something,” he remarked. “That particular question did as
    well as any other.”</p>
<p>I stared at him.</p>
<p>“At any rate, my friend,” he said more seriously, “I know now something
    I wanted to know. Let us leave it at that.”</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">AN EVENING AT MAH JONG</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> night we had a little Mah Jong party. This kind of simple
    entertainment is very popular in King’s Abbot. The guests arrive in
    goloshes and waterproofs after dinner. They partake of coffee and later
    of cake, sandwiches, and tea.</p>
<p>On this particular night our guests were Miss Ganett and Colonel
    Carter, who lives near the church. A good deal of gossip is handed
    round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the
    game in progress. We used to play bridge—chatty bridge of the worst
    description. We find Mah Jong much more peaceful. The irritated demand
    as to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely
    done away with, and though we still express criticisms frankly, there
    is not the same acrimonious spirit.</p>
<p>“Very cold evening, eh, Sheppard?” said Colonel Carter, standing with
    his back to the fire. Caroline had taken Miss Ganett to her own room,
    and was there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps.
    “Reminds me of the Afghan passes.”</p>
<p>“Indeed?” I said politely.</p>
<p>“Very mysterious business this about poor Ackroyd,” continued the
    colonel, accepting a cup of coffee. “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> deuce of a lot behind it—that’s
    what I say. Between you and me, Sheppard, I’ve heard the word blackmail
    mentioned!”</p>
<p>The colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “one man of the
    world to another.”</p>
<p>“A woman in it, no doubt,” he said. “Depend upon it, a woman in it.”</p>
<p>Caroline and Miss Ganett joined us at this minute. Miss Ganett drank
    coffee whilst Caroline got out the Mah Jong box and poured out the
    tiles upon the table.</p>
<p>“Washing the tiles,” said the colonel facetiously. “That’s
    right—washing the tiles, as we used to say in the Shanghai Club.”</p>
<p>It is the private opinion of both Caroline and myself that Colonel
    Carter has never been in the Shanghai Club in his life. More, that he
    has never been farther east than India, where he juggled with tins of
    bully beef and plum and apple jam during the Great War. But the colonel
    is determinedly military, and in King’s Abbot we permit people to
    indulge their little idiosyncrasies freely.</p>
<p>“Shall we begin?” said Caroline.</p>
<p>We sat round the table. For some five minutes there was complete
    silence, owing to the fact that there is tremendous secret competition
    amongst us as to who can build their wall quickest.</p>
<p>“Go on, James,” said Caroline at last. “You’re East Wind.”</p>
<p>I discarded a tile. A round or two proceeded, broken by the monotonous
    remarks of “Three Bamboos,” “Two Circles,” “Pung,” and frequently
    from Miss Ganett “Unpung,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> owing to that lady’s habit of too hastily
    claiming tiles to which she had no right.</p>
<p>“I saw Flora Ackroyd this morning,” said Miss Ganett. “Pung—no—Unpung.
    I made a mistake.”</p>
<p>“Four Circles,” said Caroline. “Where did you see her?”</p>
<p>“She didn’t see <em>me</em>,” said Miss Ganett, with that tremendous
    significance only to be met with in small villages.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Caroline interestedly. “Chow.”</p>
<p>“I believe,” said Miss Ganett, temporarily diverted, “that it’s the
    right thing nowadays to say ‘Chee’ not ‘Chow.’”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I have always said ‘<em>Chow</em>.’”</p>
<p>“In the Shanghai Club,” said Colonel Carter, “they say ‘<em>Chow</em>.’”</p>
<p>Miss Ganett retired, crushed.</p>
<p>“What were you saying about Flora Ackroyd?” asked Caroline, after a
    moment or two devoted to the game. “Was she with any one?”</p>
<p>“Very much so,” said Miss Ganett.</p>
<p>The eyes of the two ladies met, and seemed to exchange information.</p>
<p>“Really,” said Caroline interestedly. “Is that it? Well, it doesn’t
    surprise me in the least.”</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for you to discard, Miss Caroline,” said the colonel. He
    sometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and
    indifferent to gossip. But nobody is deceived.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>
<p>“If you ask me,” said Miss Ganett. (“Was that a Bamboo you discarded,
    dear? Oh! no, I see now—it was a Circle.) As I was saying, if you ask
    me, Flora’s been exceedingly lucky. Exceedingly lucky she’s been.”</p>
<p>“How’s that, Miss Ganett?” asked the colonel. “I’ll Pung that Green
    Dragon. How do you make out that Miss Flora’s been lucky? Very charming
    girl and all that, I know.”</p>
<p>“I mayn’t know very much about crime,” said Miss Ganett, with the air
    of one who knows everything there is to know, “but I can tell you one
    thing. The first question that’s always asked is ‘Who last saw the
    deceased alive?’ And the person who did is regarded with suspicion.
    Now, Flora Ackroyd last saw her uncle alive. It might have looked very
    nasty for her—very nasty indeed. It’s my opinion—and I give it for what
    it’s worth, that Ralph Paton is staying away on her account, to draw
    suspicion away from her.”</p>
<p>“Come, now,” I protested mildly, “you surely can’t suggest that a young
    girl like Flora Ackroyd is capable of stabbing her uncle in cold blood?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Miss Ganett. “I’ve just been reading a book
    from the library about the underworld of Paris, and it says that some
    of the worst women criminals are young girls with the faces of angels.”</p>
<p>“That’s in France,” said Caroline instantly.</p>
<p>“Just so,” said the colonel. “Now, I’ll tell you a very curious thing—a
    story that was going round the Bazaars in India....”</p>
<p>The colonel’s story was one of interminable length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> and of curiously
    little interest. A thing that happened in India many years ago cannot
    compare for a moment with an event that took place in King’s Abbot the
    day before yesterday.</p>
<p>It was Caroline who brought the colonel’s story to a close by
    fortunately going Mah Jong. After the slight unpleasantness always
    occasioned by my corrections of Caroline’s somewhat faulty arithmetic,
    we started a new hand.</p>
<p>“East Wind passes,” said Caroline. “I’ve got an idea of my own about
    Ralph Paton. Three Characters. But I’m keeping it to myself for the
    present.”</p>
<p>“Are you, dear?” said Miss Ganett. “Chow—I mean Pung.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Caroline firmly.</p>
<p>“Was it all right about the boots?” asked Miss Ganett. “Their being
    black, I mean?”</p>
<p>“Quite all right,” said Caroline.</p>
<p>“What was the point, do you think?” asked Miss Ganett.</p>
<p>Caroline pursed up her lips, and shook her head with an air of knowing
    all about it.</p>
<p>“Pung,” said Miss Ganett. “No—Unpung. I suppose that now the doctor’s
    in with M. Poirot he knows all the secrets?”</p>
<p>“Far from it,” I said.</p>
<p>“James is so modest,” said Caroline. “Ah! a concealed Kong.”</p>
<p>The colonel gave vent to a whistle. For the moment gossip was
    forgotten.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>
<p>“Your own wind, too,” he said. “<em>And</em> you’ve got two Pungs of
    Dragons. We must be careful. Miss Caroline’s out for a big hand.”</p>
<p>We played for some minutes with no irrelevant conversation.</p>
<p>“This M. Poirot now,” said Colonel Carter, “is he really such a great
    detective?”</p>
<p>“The greatest the world has ever known,” said Caroline solemnly. “He
    had to come here incognito to avoid publicity.”</p>
<p>“Chow,” said Miss Ganett. “Quite wonderful for our little village, I’m
    sure. By the way, Clara—my maid, you know—is great friends with Elsie,
    the housemaid at Fernly, and what do you think Elsie told her? That
    there’s been a lot of money stolen, and it’s her opinion—Elsie’s—I
    mean, that the parlormaid had something to do with it. She’s leaving
    at the month, and she’s crying a good deal at night. If you ask me,
    the girl is very likely in league with a <em>gang</em>. She’s always
    been a queer girl—she’s not friends with any of the girls round here.
    She goes off by herself on her days out—very unnatural, I call it,
    and most suspicious. I asked her once to come to our Girls’ Friendly
    Evenings, but she refused, and then I asked her a few questions about
    her home and her family—all that sort of thing, and I’m bound to say I
    considered her manner most impertinent. Outwardly very respectful—but
    she shut me up in the most barefaced way.”</p>
<p>Miss Ganett stopped for breath, and the colonel, who was totally
    uninterested in the servant question, remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> that in the Shanghai
    Club brisk play was the invariable rule.</p>
<p>We had a round of brisk play.</p>
<p>“That Miss Russell,” said Caroline. “She came here pretending to
    consult James on Friday morning. It’s my opinion she wanted to see
    where the poisons were kept. Five Characters.”</p>
<p>“Chow,” said Miss Ganett. “What an extraordinary idea? I wonder if you
    can be right.”</p>
<p>“Talking of poisons,” said the colonel. “Eh—what? Haven’t I discarded?
    Oh! Eight Bamboos.”</p>
<p>“Mah Jong!” said Miss Ganett.</p>
<p>Caroline was very much annoyed.</p>
<p>“One Red Dragon,” she said regretfully, “and I should have had a hand
    of three doubles.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had two Red Dragons all the time,” I mentioned.</p>
<p>“So exactly like you, James,” said Caroline reproachfully. “You’ve no
    conception of the spirit of the game.”</p>
<p>I myself thought I had played rather cleverly. I should have had to pay
    Caroline an enormous amount if she had gone Mah Jong. Miss Ganett’s Mah
    Jong was of the poorest variety possible, as Caroline did not fail to
    point out to her.</p>
<p>East Wind passed, and we started a new hand in silence.</p>
<p>“What I was going to tell you just now was this,” said Caroline.</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Miss Ganett encouragingly.</p>
<p>“My idea about Ralph Paton, I mean.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>
<p>“Yes, dear,” said Miss Ganett, still more encouragingly. “Chow!”</p>
<p>“It’s a sign of weakness to Chow so early,” said Caroline severely.
    “You should go for a big hand.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Miss Ganett. “You were saying—about Ralph Paton, you
    know?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well, I’ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is.”</p>
<p>We all stopped to stare at her.</p>
<p>“This is very interesting, Miss Caroline,” said Colonel Carter. “All
    your own idea, eh?”</p>
<p>“Well, not exactly. I’ll tell you about it. You know that big map of
    the county we have in the hall?”</p>
<p>We all said Yes.</p>
<p>“As M. Poirot was going out the other day, he stopped and looked at it,
    and he made some remark—I can’t remember exactly what it was. Something
    about Cranchester being the only big town anywhere near us—which is
    true, of course. But after he had gone—it came to me suddenly.”</p>
<p>“What came to you?”</p>
<p>“His meaning. Of course Ralph is in Cranchester.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment that I knocked down the rack that held my pieces.
    My sister immediately reproved me for clumsiness, but half-heartedly.
    She was intent on her theory.</p>
<p>“Cranchester, Miss Caroline?” said Colonel Carter. “Surely not
    Cranchester! It’s so near.”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly it,” cried Caroline triumphantly. “It seems quite clear
    by now that he didn’t get away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> here by train. He must simply have
    walked into Cranchester. And I believe he’s there still. No one would
    dream of his being so near at hand.”</p>
<p>I pointed out several objections to the theory, but when once Caroline
    has got something firmly into her head, nothing dislodges it.</p>
<p>“And you think M. Poirot has the same idea,” said Miss Ganett
    thoughtfully. “It’s a curious coincidence, but I was out for a walk
    this afternoon on the Cranchester road, and he passed me in a car
    coming from that direction.”</p>
<p>We all looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Why, dear me,” said Miss Ganett suddenly, “I’m Mah Jong all the time,
    and I never noticed it.”</p>
<p>Caroline’s attention was distracted from her own inventive exercises.
    She pointed out to Miss Ganett that a hand consisting of mixed suits
    and too many Chows was hardly worth going Mah Jong on. Miss Ganett
    listened imperturbably and collected her counters.</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, I know what you mean,” she said. “But it rather depends on
    what kind of a hand you have to start with, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“You’ll never get the big hands if you don’t go for them,” urged
    Caroline.</p>
<p>“Well, we must all play our own way, mustn’t we?” said Miss Ganett. She
    looked down at her counters. “After all, I’m up, so far.”</p>
<p>Caroline, who was considerably down, said nothing.</p>
<p>East Wind passed, and we set to once more. Annie brought in the tea
    things. Caroline and Miss Ganett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> were both slightly ruffled as is
    often the case during one of these festive evenings.</p>
<p>“If you would only play a leetle quicker, dear,” said Caroline, as Miss
    Ganett hesitated over her discard. “The Chinese put down the tiles so
    quickly it sounds like little birds pattering.”</p>
<p>For some few minutes we played like the Chinese.</p>
<p>“You haven’t contributed much to the sum of information, Sheppard,”
    said Colonel Carter genially. “You’re a sly dog. Hand in glove with the
    great detective, and not a hint as to the way things are going.”</p>
<p>“James is an extraordinary creature,” said Caroline. “He can <em>not</em>
    bring himself to part with information.”</p>
<p>She looked at me with some disfavor.</p>
<p>“I assure you,” I said, “that I don’t know anything. Poirot keeps his
    own counsel.”</p>
<p>“Wise man,” said the colonel with a chuckle. “He doesn’t give himself
    away. But they’re wonderful fellows, these foreign detectives. Up to
    all sorts of dodges, I believe.”</p>
<p>“Pung,” said Miss Ganett, in a tone of quiet triumph. “And Mah Jong.”</p>
<p>The situation became more strained. It was annoyance at Miss Ganett’s
    going Mah Jong for the third time running which prompted Caroline to
    say to me as we built a fresh wall:—</p>
<p>“You are too tiresome, James. You sit there like a dead head, and say
    nothing at all!”</p>
<p>“But, my dear,” I protested, “I have really nothing to say—that is, of
    the kind you mean.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Caroline, as she sorted her hand. “You <em>must</em>
    know something interesting.”</p>
<p>I did not answer for a moment. I was overwhelmed and intoxicated. I had
    read of there being such a thing as the Perfect Winning—going Mah Jong
    on one’s original hand. I had never hoped to hold the hand myself.</p>
<p>With suppressed triumph I laid my hand face upwards on the table.</p>
<p>“As they say in the Shanghai Club,” I remarked, “Tin-ho—the Perfect
    Winning!”</p>
<p>The colonel’s eyes nearly bulged out of his head.</p>
<p>“Upon my soul,” he said. “What an extraordinary thing. I never saw that
    happen before!”</p>
<p>It was then that I went on, goaded by Caroline’s gibes, and rendered
    reckless by my triumph.</p>
<p>“And as to anything interesting,” I said. “What about a gold wedding
    ring with a date and ‘From R.’ inside.”</p>
<p>I pass over the scene that followed. I was made to say exactly where
    this treasure was found. I was made to reveal the date.</p>
<p>“March 13th,” said Caroline. “Just six months ago. Ah!”</p>
<p>Out of the babel of excited suggestions and suppositions three theories
    were evolved:—</p>
<p>1. That of Colonel Carter: that Ralph was secretly married to Flora.
    The first or most simple solution.</p>
<p>2. That of Miss Ganett: that Roger Ackroyd had been secretly married to
    Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
<p>3. That of my sister: that Roger Ackroyd had married his housekeeper,
    Miss Russell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>
<p>A fourth or super-theory was propounded by Caroline later as we went up
    to bed.</p>
<p>“Mark my words,” she said suddenly, “I shouldn’t be at all surprised if
    Geoffrey Raymond and Flora weren’t married.”</p>
<p>“Surely it would be ‘From G,’ not ‘From R’ then,” I suggested.</p>
<p>“You never know. Some girls call men by their surnames. And you heard
    what Miss Ganett said this evening—about Flora’s carryings on.”</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, I had not heard Miss Ganett say anything of the
    kind, but I respected Caroline’s knowledge of innuendoes.</p>
<p>“How about Hector Blunt,” I hinted. “If it’s anybody——”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I dare say he admires her—may even be in
    love with her. But depend upon it a girl isn’t going to fall in love
    with a man old enough to be her father when there’s a good-looking
    young secretary about. She may encourage Major Blunt just as a blind.
    Girls are very artful. But there’s one thing I <em>do</em> tell you,
    James Sheppard. Flora Ackroyd does not care a penny piece for Ralph
    Paton, and never has. You can take it from me.”</p>
<p>I took it from her meekly.</p>

<div class="subhead">PARKER</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration
    produced by Tin-ho, or the Perfect Winning, I might have been slightly
    indiscreet. True, Poirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of
    the ring to myself. On the other hand, he had said nothing about it
    whilst at Fernly, and as far as I knew, I was the only person aware
    that it had been found. I felt distinctly guilty. The fact was by now
    spreading through King’s Abbot like wildfire. I was expecting wholesale
    reproaches from Poirot any minute.</p>
<p>The joint funeral of Mrs. Ferrars and Roger Ackroyd was fixed for
    eleven o’clock. It was a melancholy and impressive ceremony. All the
    party from Fernly were there.</p>
<p>After it was over, Poirot, who had also been present, took me by the
    arm, and invited me to accompany him back to The Larches. He was
    looking very grave, and I feared that my indiscretion of the night
    before had got round to his ears. But it soon transpired that his
    thoughts were occupied by something of a totally different nature.</p>
<p>“See you,” he said. “We must act. With your help I propose to examine a
    witness. We will question him, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> will put such fear into him that the
    truth is bound to come out.”</p>
<p>“What witness are you talking of?” I asked, very much surprised.</p>
<p>“Parker!” said Poirot. “I asked him to be at my house this morning at
    twelve o’clock. He should await us there at this very minute.”</p>
<p>“What do you think,” I ventured, glancing sideways at his face.</p>
<p>“I know this—that I am not satisfied.”</p>
<p>“You think that it was he who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars?”</p>
<p>“Either that, or——”</p>
<p>“Well?” I said, after waiting a minute or two.</p>
<p>“My friend, I will say this to you—I hope it was he.”</p>
<p>The gravity of his manner, and something indefinable that tinged it,
    reduced me to silence.</p>
<p>On arrival at The Larches, we were informed that Parker was already
    there awaiting our return. As we entered the room, the butler rose
    respectfully.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Parker,” said Poirot pleasantly. “One instant, I pray of
    you.”</p>
<p>He removed his overcoat and gloves.</p>
<p>“Allow me, sir,” said Parker, and sprang forward to assist him. He
    deposited the articles neatly on a chair by the door. Poirot watched
    him with approval.</p>
<p>“Thank you, my good Parker,” he said. “Take a seat, will you not? What
    I have to say may take some time.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>
<p>Parker seated himself with an apologetic bend of the head.</p>
<p>“Now what do you think I asked you to come here for this morning—eh?”</p>
<p>Parker coughed.</p>
<p>“I understood, sir, that you wished to ask me a few questions about my
    late master—private like.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Précisément</i>,” said Poirot, beaming. “Have you made many
    experiments in blackmail?”</p>
<p>“Sir!”</p>
<p>The butler sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>“Do not excite yourself,” said Poirot placidly. “Do not play the farce
    of the honest, injured man. You know all there is to know about the
    blackmail, is it not so?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I—I’ve never—never been——”</p>
<p>“Insulted,” suggested Poirot, “in such a way before. Then why, my
    excellent Parker, were you so anxious to overhear the conversation in
    Mr. Ackroyd’s study the other evening, after you had caught the word
    blackmail?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t—I——”</p>
<p>“Who was your last master?” rapped out Poirot suddenly.</p>
<p>“My last master?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the master you were with before you came to Mr. Ackroyd.”</p>
<p>“A Major Ellerby, sir——”</p>
<p>Poirot took the words out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Just so, Major Ellerby. Major Ellerby was addicted to drugs, was he
    not? You traveled about with him. When he was in Bermuda there was some
    trouble—a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> was killed. Major Ellerby was partly responsible. It was
    hushed up. But you knew about it. How much did Major Ellerby pay you to
    keep your mouth shut?”</p>
<p>Parker was staring at him open-mouthed. The man had gone to pieces, his
    cheeks shook flabbily.</p>
<p>“You see, me, I have made inquiries,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It is
    as I say. You got a good sum then as blackmail, and Major Ellerby went
    on paying you until he died. Now I want to hear about your latest
    experiment.”</p>
<p>Parker still stared.</p>
<p>“It is useless to deny. Hercule Poirot <em>knows</em>. It is so, what I
    have said about Major Ellerby, is it not?”</p>
<p>As though against his will, Parker nodded reluctantly once. His face
    was ashen pale.</p>
<p>“But I never hurt a hair of Mr. Ackroyd’s head,” he moaned. “Honest to
    God, sir, I didn’t. I’ve been afraid of this coming all the time. And I
    tell you I didn’t—I didn’t kill him.”</p>
<p>His voice rose almost to a scream.</p>
<p>“I am inclined to believe you, my friend,” said Poirot. “You have not
    the nerve—the courage. But I must have the truth.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you anything, sir, anything you want to know. It’s true that
    I tried to listen that night. A word or two I heard made me curious.
    And Mr. Ackroyd’s wanting not to be disturbed, and shutting himself up
    with the doctor the way he did. It’s God’s own truth what I told the
    police. I heard the word blackmail, sir, and well——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“You thought there might be something in it for you?” suggested Poirot
    smoothly.</p>
<p>“Well—well, yes, I did, sir. I thought that if Mr. Ackroyd was being
    blackmailed, why shouldn’t I have a share of the pickings?”</p>
<p>A very curious expression passed over Poirot’s face. He leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Had you any reason to suppose before that night that Mr. Ackroyd was
    being blackmailed?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed, sir. It was a great surprise to me. Such a regular
    gentleman in all his habits.”</p>
<p>“How much did you overhear?”</p>
<p>“Not very much, sir. There seemed what I might call a spite against me.
    Of course I had to attend to my duties in the pantry. And when I did
    creep along once or twice to the study it was no use. The first time
    Dr. Sheppard came out and almost caught me in the act, and another time
    Mr. Raymond passed me in the big hall and went that way, so I knew it
    was no use; and when I went with the tray, Miss Flora headed me off.”</p>
<p>Poirot stared for a long time at the man, as if to test his sincerity.
    Parker returned his gaze earnestly.</p>
<p>“I hope you believe me, sir. I’ve been afraid all along the police
    would rake up that old business with Major Ellerby and be suspicious of
    me in consequence.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Eh bien</i>,” said Poirot at last. “I am disposed to believe you.
    But there is one thing I must request of you—to show me your bank-book.
    You have a bank-book, I presume?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>
<p>“Yes, sir, as a matter of fact, I have it with me now.”</p>
<p>With no sign of confusion, he produced it from his pocket. Poirot took
    the slim, green-covered book and perused the entries.</p>
<p>“Ah! I perceive you have purchased £500 of National Savings
    Certificates this year?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of
    my connection with—er—my late master, Major Ellerby. And I have had
    quite a little flutter on some horses this year—very successful. If you
    remember, sir, a rank outsider won the Jubilee. I was fortunate enough
    to back it—£20.”</p>
<p>Poirot handed him back the book.</p>
<p>“I will wish you good-morning. I believe that you have told me the
    truth. If you have not—so much the worse for you, my friend.”</p>
<p>When Parker had departed, Poirot picked up his overcoat once more.</p>
<p>“Going out again?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, we will pay a little visit to the good M. Hammond.”</p>
<p>“You believe Parker’s story?”</p>
<p>“It is credible enough on the face of it. It seems clear that—unless
    he is a very good actor indeed—he genuinely believes it was Ackroyd
    himself who was the victim of blackmail. If so, he knows nothing at all
    about the Mrs. Ferrars business.”</p>
<p>“Then in that case—who——”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Précisément!</i> Who? But our visit to M. Hammond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> will accomplish
    one purpose. It will either clear Parker completely or else——”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“I fall into the bad habit of leaving my sentences unfinished this
    morning,” said Poirot apologetically. “You must bear with me.”</p>
<p>“By the way,” I said, rather sheepishly, “I’ve got a confession to
    make. I’m afraid I have inadvertently let out something about that
    ring.”</p>
<p>“What ring?”</p>
<p>“The ring you found in the goldfish pond.”</p>
<p>“Ah! yes,” said Poirot, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re not annoyed? It was very careless of me.”</p>
<p>“But not at all, my good friend, not at all. I laid no commands upon
    you. You were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished. She was
    interested, your sister?”</p>
<p>“She was indeed. It created a sensation. All sorts of theories are
    flying about.”</p>
<p>“Ah! And yet it is so simple. The true explanation leapt to the eye,
    did it not?”</p>
<p>“Did it?” I said dryly.</p>
<p>Poirot laughed.</p>
<p>“The wise man does not commit himself,” he observed. “Is not that so?
    But here we are at Mr. Hammond’s.”</p>
<p>The lawyer was in his office, and we were ushered in without any delay.
    He rose and greeted us in his dry, precise manner.</p>
<p>Poirot came at once to the point.</p>
<p>“Monsieur, I desire from you certain information, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> is, if you will
    be so good as to give it to me. You acted, I understand, for the late
    Mrs. Ferrars of King’s Paddock?”</p>
<p>I noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer’s
    eyes, before his professional reserve came down once more like a mask
    over his face.</p>
<p>“Certainly. All her affairs passed through our hands.”</p>
<p>“Very good. Now, before I ask you to tell me anything, I should like
    you to listen to the story Dr. Sheppard will relate to you. You have no
    objection, have you, my friend, to repeating the conversation you had
    with Mr. Ackroyd last Friday night?”</p>
<p>“Not in the least,” I said, and straightway began the recital of that
    strange evening.</p>
<p>Hammond listened with close attention.</p>
<p>“That is all,” I said, when I had finished.</p>
<p>“Blackmail,” said the lawyer thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“You are surprised?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>The lawyer took off his pince-nez and polished them with his
    handkerchief.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied, “I can hardly say that I am surprised. I have
    suspected something of the kind for some time.”</p>
<p>“That brings us,” said Poirot, “to the information for which I am
    asking. If any one can give us an idea of the actual sums paid, you are
    the man, monsieur.”</p>
<p>“I see no object in withholding the information,” said Hammond, after
    a moment or two. “During the past year, Mrs. Ferrars has sold out
    certain securities, and the money for them was paid into her account
    and not reinvested. As her income was a large one, and she lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> very
    quietly after her husband’s death, it seems certain that these sums of
    money were paid away for some special purpose. I once sounded her on
    the subject, and she said that she was obliged to support several of
    her husband’s poor relations. I let the matter drop, of course. Until
    now, I have always imagined that the money was paid to some woman who
    had had a claim on Ashley Ferrars. I never dreamed that Mrs. Ferrars
    herself was involved.”</p>
<p>“And the amount?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>“In all, I should say the various sums totaled at least twenty thousand
    pounds.”</p>
<p>“Twenty thousand pounds!” I exclaimed. “In one year!”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ferrars was a very wealthy woman,” said Poirot dryly. “And the
    penalty for murder is not a pleasant one.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything else that I can tell you?” inquired Mr. Hammond.</p>
<p>“I thank you, no,” said Poirot, rising. “All my excuses for having
    deranged you.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all.”</p>
<p>“The word derange,” I remarked, when we were outside again, “is
    applicable to mental disorder only.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried Poirot, “never will my English be quite perfect. A curious
    language. I should then have said disarranged, <i lang="fr">n’est-ce pas</i>?”</p>
<p>“Disturbed is the word you had in mind.”</p>
<p>“I thank you, my friend. The word exact, you are zealous for it. <i lang="fr">Eh
    bien</i>, what about our friend Parker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> now? With twenty thousand
    pounds in hand, would he have continued being a butler? <i lang="fr">Je ne pense
    pas.</i> It is, of course, possible that he banked the money under
    another name, but I am disposed to believe he spoke the truth to us.
    If he is a scoundrel, he is a scoundrel on a mean scale. He has not
    the big ideas. That leaves us as a possibility, Raymond, or—well—Major
    Blunt.”</p>
<p>“Surely not Raymond,” I objected. “Since we know that he was
    desperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds.”</p>
<p>“That is what he says, yes.”</p>
<p>“And as to Hector Blunt——”</p>
<p>“I will tell you something as to the good Major Blunt,” interrupted
    Poirot. “It is my business to make inquiries. I make them. <i lang="fr">Eh
    bien</i>—that legacy of which he speaks, I have discovered that the
    amount of it was close upon twenty thousand pounds. What do you think
    of that?”</p>
<p>I was so taken aback that I could hardly speak.</p>
<p>“It’s impossible,” I said at last. “A well-known man like Hector Blunt.”</p>
<p>Poirot shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Who knows? At least he is a man with big ideas. I confess that I
    hardly see him as a blackmailer, but there is another possibility that
    you have not even considered.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“The fire, my friend. Ackroyd himself may have destroyed that letter,
    blue envelope and all, after you left him.”</p>
<p>“I hardly think that likely,” I said slowly. “And yet—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>of course, it
    may be so. He might have changed his mind.”</p>
<p>We had just arrived at my house, and on the spur of the moment I
    invited Poirot to come in and take pot luck.</p>
<p>I thought Caroline would be pleased with me, but it is hard to satisfy
    one’s women folk. It appears that we were eating chops for lunch—the
    kitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions. And two chops set
    before three people are productive of embarrassment.</p>
<p>But Caroline is seldom daunted for long. With magnificent mendacity,
    she explained to Poirot that although James laughed at her for
    doing so, she adhered strictly to a vegetarian diet. She descanted
    ecstatically on the delights of nut cutlets (which I am quite sure
    she has never tasted) and ate a Welsh rarebit with gusto and frequent
    cutting remarks as to the dangers of “flesh” foods.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking,
    Caroline attacked Poirot directly.</p>
<p>“Not found Ralph Paton yet?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Where should I find him, mademoiselle?”</p>
<p>“I thought, perhaps, you’d found him in Cranchester,” said Caroline,
    with intense meaning in her tone.</p>
<p>Poirot looked merely bewildered.</p>
<p>“In Cranchester? But why in Cranchester?”</p>
<p>I enlightened him with a touch of malice.</p>
<p>“One of our ample staff of private detectives happened to see you in a
    car on the Cranchester road yesterday,” I explained.</p>
<p>Poirot’s bewilderment vanished. He laughed heartily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>
<p>“Ah, that! A simple visit to the dentist, <i lang="fr">c’est tout</i>. My tooth,
    it aches. I go there. My tooth, it is at once better. I think to return
    quickly. The dentist, he says No. Better to have it out. I argue. He
    insists. He has his way! That particular tooth, it will never ache
    again.”</p>
<p>Caroline collapsed rather like a pricked balloon.</p>
<p>We fell to discussing Ralph Paton.</p>
<p>“A weak nature,” I insisted. “But not a vicious one.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Poirot. “But weakness, where does it end?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Caroline. “Take James here—weak as water, if I weren’t
    about to look after him.”</p>
<p>“My dear Caroline,” I said irritably, “can’t you talk without dragging
    in personalities?”</p>
<p>“You <em>are</em> weak, James,” said Caroline, quite unmoved. “I’m eight
    years older than you are—oh! I don’t mind M. Poirot knowing that——”</p>
<p>“I should never have guessed it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot, with a
    gallant little bow.</p>
<p>“Eight years older. But I’ve always considered it my duty to look after
    you. With a bad bringing up, Heaven knows what mischief you might have
    got into by now.”</p>
<p>“I might have married a beautiful adventuress,” I murmured, gazing at
    the ceiling, and blowing smoke rings.</p>
<p>“Adventuress!” said Caroline, with a snort. “If we’re talking of
    adventuresses——”</p>
<p>She left the sentence unfinished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>
<p>“Well?” I said, with some curiosity.</p>
<p>“Nothing. But I can think of some one not a hundred miles away.”</p>
<p>Then she turned to Poirot suddenly.</p>
<p>“James sticks to it that you believe some one in the house committed
    the murder. All I can say is, you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“I should not like to be wrong,” said Poirot. “It is not—how do you
    say—my <i lang="fr">métier</i>?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got the facts pretty clearly,” continued Caroline, taking no
    notice of Poirot’s remark, “from James and others. As far as I can see,
    of the people in the house, only two <em>could</em> have had the chance
    of doing it. Ralph Paton and Flora Ackroyd.”</p>
<p>“My dear Caroline——”</p>
<p>“Now, James, don’t interrupt me. I know what I’m talking about. Parker
    met her <em>outside</em> the door, didn’t he? He didn’t hear her uncle
    saying good-night to her. She could have killed him then and there.”</p>
<p>“Caroline.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying she <em>did</em>, James. I’m saying she <em>could</em> have
    done. As a matter of fact, though Flora is like all these young girls
    nowadays, with no veneration for their betters and thinking they know
    best on every subject under the sun, I don’t for a minute believe she’d
    kill even a chicken. But there it is. Mr. Raymond and Major Blunt have
    alibis. Mrs. Ackroyd’s got an alibi. Even that Russell woman seems to
    have one—and a good job for her it is she has. Who is left? Only Ralph
    and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> Flora! And say what you will, I don’t believe Ralph Paton is a
    murderer. A boy we’ve known all our lives.”</p>
<p>Poirot was silent for a minute, watching the curling smoke rise from
    his cigarette. When at last he spoke, it was in a gentle far-away voice
    that produced a curious impression. It was totally unlike his usual
    manner.</p>
<p>“Let us take a man—a very ordinary man. A man with no idea of murder
    in his heart. There is in him somewhere a strain of weakness—deep
    down. It has so far never been called into play. Perhaps it never will
    be—and if so he will go to his grave honored and respected by every
    one. But let us suppose that something occurs. He is in difficulties—or
    perhaps not that even. He may stumble by accident on a secret—a secret
    involving life or death to some one. And his first impulse will be to
    speak out—to do his duty as an honest citizen. And then the strain of
    weakness tells. Here is a chance of money—a great amount of money.
    He wants money—he desires it—and it is so easy. He has to do nothing
    for it—just keep silence. That is the beginning. The desire for money
    grows. He must have more—and more! He is intoxicated by the gold mine
    which has opened at his feet. He becomes greedy. And in his greed he
    overreaches himself. One can press a man as far as one likes—but with
    a woman one must not press too far. For a woman has at heart a great
    desire to speak the truth. How many husbands who have deceived their
    wives go comfortably to their graves, carrying their secret with them!
    How many wives who have deceived their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> husbands wreck their lives by
    throwing the fact in those same husbands’ teeth! They have been pressed
    too far. In a reckless moment (which they will afterwards regret,
    <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>) they fling safety to the winds and turn at bay,
    proclaiming the truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves.
    So it was, I think, in this case. The strain was too great. And so
    there came your proverb, the death of the goose that laid the golden
    eggs. But that is not the end. Exposure faced the man of whom we are
    speaking. And he is not the same man he was—say, a year ago. His moral
    fiber is blunted. He is desperate. He is fighting a losing battle, and
    he is prepared to take any means that come to his hand, for exposure
    means ruin to him. And so—the dagger strikes!”</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. It was as though he had laid a spell upon
    the room. I cannot try to describe the impression his words produced.
    There was something in the merciless analysis, and the ruthless power
    of vision which struck fear into both of us.</p>
<p>“Afterwards,” he went on softly, “the danger removed, he will be
    himself again, normal, kindly. But if the need again arises, then once
    more he will strike.”</p>
<p>Caroline roused herself at last.</p>
<p>“You are speaking of Ralph Paton,” she said. “You may be right, you may
    not, but you have no business to condemn a man unheard.”</p>
<p>The telephone bell rang sharply. I went out into the hall, and took off
    the receiver.</p>
<p>“What?” I said. “Yes. Dr. Sheppard speaking.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>
<p>I listened for a minute or two, then replied briefly. Replacing the
    receiver, I went back into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>“Poirot,” I said, “they have detained a man at Liverpool. His name is
    Charles Kent, and he is believed to be the stranger who visited Fernly
    that night. They want me to go to Liverpool at once and identify him.”</p>

<div class="subhead">CHARLES KENT</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Half</span> an hour later saw Poirot, myself, and Inspector Raglan in the
    train on the way to Liverpool. The inspector was clearly very excited.</p>
<p>“We may get a line on the blackmailing part of the business, if on
    nothing else,” he declared jubilantly. “He’s a rough customer, this
    fellow, by what I heard over the phone. Takes dope, too. We ought to
    find it easy to get what we want out of him. If there was the shadow of
    a motive, nothing’s more likely than that he killed Mr. Ackroyd. But in
    that case, why is young Paton keeping out of the way? The whole thing’s
    a muddle—that’s what it is. By the way, M. Poirot, you were quite right
    about those fingerprints. They were Mr. Ackroyd’s own. I had rather the
    same idea myself, but I dismissed it as hardly feasible.”</p>
<p>I smiled to myself. Inspector Raglan was so very plainly saving his
    face.</p>
<p>“As regards this man,” said Poirot, “he is not yet arrested, eh?”</p>
<p>“No, detained under suspicion.”</p>
<p>“And what account does he give of himself?”</p>
<p>“Precious little,” said the inspector, with a grin. “He’s a wary bird,
    I gather. A lot of abuse, but very little more.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>
<p>On arrival at Liverpool I was surprised to find that Poirot was
    welcomed with acclamation. Superintendent Hayes, who met us, had worked
    with Poirot over some case long ago, and had evidently an exaggerated
    opinion of his powers.</p>
<p>“Now we’ve got M. Poirot here we shan’t be long,” he said cheerfully.
    “I thought you’d retired, moosior?”</p>
<p>“So I had, my good Hayes, so I had. But how tedious is retirement! You
    cannot imagine to yourself the monotony with which day comes after day.”</p>
<p>“Very likely. So you’ve come to have a look at our own particular find?
    Is this Dr. Sheppard? Think you’ll be able to identify him, sir?”</p>
<p>“I’m not very sure,” I said doubtfully.</p>
<p>“How did you get hold of him?” inquired Poirot.</p>
<p>“Description was circulated, as you know. In the press and privately.
    Not much to go on, I admit. This fellow has an American accent all
    right, and he doesn’t deny that he was near King’s Abbot that night.
    Just asks what the hell it is to do with us, and that he’ll see us in
    —— before he answers any questions.”</p>
<p>“Is it permitted that I, too, see him?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>The superintendent closed one eye knowingly.</p>
<p>“Very glad to have you, sir. You’ve got permission to do anything you
    please. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard was asking after you the other
    day. Said he’d heard you were connected unofficially with this case.
    Where’s Captain Paton hiding, sir, can you tell me that?”</p>
<p>“I doubt if it would be wise at the present juncture,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> said Poirot
    primly, and I bit my lips to prevent a smile.</p>
<p>The little man really did it very well.</p>
<p>After some further parley, we were taken to interview the prisoner.</p>
<p>He was a young fellow, I should say not more than twenty-two or
    three. Tall, thin, with slightly shaking hands, and the evidences of
    considerable physical strength somewhat run to seed. His hair was dark,
    but his eyes were blue and shifty, seldom meeting a glance squarely. I
    had all along cherished the illusion that there was something familiar
    about the figure I had met that night, but if this were indeed he, I
    was completely mistaken. He did not remind me in the least of any one I
    knew.</p>
<p>“Now then, Kent,” said the superintendent, “stand up. Here are some
    visitors come to see you. Recognize any of them.”</p>
<p>Kent glared at us sullenly, but did not reply. I saw his glance waver
    over the three of us, and come back to rest on me.</p>
<p>“Well, sir,” said the superintendent to me, “what do you say?”</p>
<p>“The height’s the same,” I said, “and as far as general appearance goes
    it might well be the man in question. Beyond that, I couldn’t go.”</p>
<p>“What the hell’s the meaning of all this?” asked Kent. “What have you
    got against me? Come on, out with it! What am I supposed to have done?”</p>
<p>I nodded my head.</p>
<p>“It’s the man,” I said. “I recognize the voice.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>
<p>“Recognize my voice, do you? Where do you think you heard it before?”</p>
<p>“On Friday evening last, outside the gates of Fernly Park. You asked me
    the way there.”</p>
<p>“I did, did I?”</p>
<p>“Do you admit it?” asked the inspector.</p>
<p>“I don’t admit anything. Not till I know what you’ve got on me.”</p>
<p>“Have you not read the papers in the last few days?” asked Poirot,
    speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>The man’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“So that’s it, is it? I saw an old gent had been croaked at Fernly.
    Trying to make out I did the job, are you?”</p>
<p>“You were there that night,” said Poirot quietly.</p>
<p>“How do you know, mister?”</p>
<p>“By this.” Poirot took something from his pocket and held it out.</p>
<p>It was the goose quill we had found in the summer-house.</p>
<p>At the sight of it the man’s face changed. He half held out his hand.</p>
<p>“Snow,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “No, my friend, it is empty. It lay
    where you dropped it in the summer-house that night.”</p>
<p>Charles Kent looked at him uncertainly.</p>
<p>“You seem to know a hell of a lot about everything, you little foreign
    cock duck. Perhaps you remember this: the papers say that the old gent
    was croaked between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>
<p>“That is so,” agreed Poirot.</p>
<p>“Yes, but is it really so? That’s what I’m getting at.”</p>
<p>“This gentleman will tell you,” said Poirot.</p>
<p>He indicated Inspector Raglan. The latter hesitated, glanced at
    Superintendent Hayes, then at Poirot, and finally, as though receiving
    sanction, he said:—</p>
<p>“That’s right. Between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ve nothing to keep me here for,” said Kent. “I was away from
    Fernly Park by twenty-five minutes past nine. You can ask at the Dog
    and Whistle. That’s a saloon about a mile out of Fernly on the road to
    Cranchester. I kicked up a bit of a row there, I remember. As near as
    nothing to quarter to ten, it was. How about that?”</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan wrote down something in his notebook.</p>
<p>“Well?” demanded Kent.</p>
<p>“Inquiries will be made,” said the inspector. “If you’ve spoken the
    truth, you won’t have anything to complain about. What were you doing
    at Fernly Park anyway?”</p>
<p>“Went there to meet some one.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“That’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“You’d better keep a civil tongue in your head, my man,” the
    superintendent warned him.</p>
<p>“To hell with a civil tongue. I went there on my own business, and
    that’s all there is to it. If I was clear away before the murder was
    done, that’s all that concerns the cops.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>
<p>“Your name, it is Charles Kent,” said Poirot. “Where were you born?”</p>
<p>The man stared at him, then he grinned.</p>
<p>“I’m a full-blown Britisher all right,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Poirot meditatively, “I think you are. I fancy you were
    born in Kent.”</p>
<p>The man stared.</p>
<p>“Why’s that? Because of my name? What’s that to do with it? Is a man
    whose name is Kent bound to be born in that particular county?”</p>
<p>“Under certain circumstances, I can imagine he might be,” said Poirot
    very deliberately. “Under certain circumstances, you comprehend.”</p>
<p>There was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police
    officers. As for Charles Kent, he flushed a brick red, and for a moment
    I thought he was going to spring at Poirot. He thought better of it,
    however, and turned away with a kind of laugh.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded as though satisfied, and made his way out through the
    door. He was joined presently by the two officers.</p>
<p>“We’ll verify that statement,” remarked Raglan. “I don’t think he’s
    lying, though. But he’s got to come clear with a statement as to
    what he was doing at Fernly. It looks to me as though we’d got our
    blackmailer all right. On the other hand, granted his story’s correct,
    he couldn’t have had anything to do with the actual murder. He’d got
    ten pounds on him when he was arrested—rather a large sum. I fancy that
    forty pounds went to him—the numbers of the notes didn’t correspond,
    but of course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> he’d have changed them first thing. Mr. Ackroyd must
    have given him the money, and he made off with it as fast as possible.
    What was that about Kent being his birthplace? What’s that got to do
    with it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing whatever,” said Poirot mildly. “A little idea of mine, that
    was all. Me, I am famous for my little ideas.”</p>
<p>“Are you really?” said Raglan, studying him with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>The superintendent went into a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>“Many’s the time I’ve heard Inspector Japp say that. M. Poirot and his
    little ideas! Too fanciful for me, he’d say, but always something in
    them.”</p>
<p>“You mock yourself at me,” said Poirot, smiling; “but never mind. The
    old ones they laugh last sometimes, when the young, clever ones do not
    laugh at all.”</p>
<p>And nodding his head at them in a sage manner, he walked out into the
    street.</p>
<p>He and I lunched together at an hotel. I know now that the whole thing
    lay clearly unravelled before him. He had got the last thread he needed
    to lead him to the truth.</p>
<p>But at the time I had no suspicion of the fact. I overestimated his
    general self-confidence, and I took it for granted that the things
    which puzzled me must be equally puzzling to him.</p>
<p>My chief puzzle was what the man Charles Kent could have been doing at
    Fernly. Again and again I put the question to myself and could get no
    satisfactory reply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>
<p>At last I ventured a tentative query to Poirot. His reply was immediate.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon ami</i>, I do not think; I know.”</p>
<p>“Really?” I said incredulously.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed. I suppose now that to you it would not make sense if I
    said that he went to Fernly that night because he was born in Kent?”</p>
<p>I stared at him.</p>
<p>“It certainly doesn’t seem to make sense to me,” I said dryly.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said Poirot pityingly. “Well, no matter. I have still my little idea.”</p>

<div class="subhead">FLORA ACKROYD</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> I was returning from my round the following morning, I was hailed by
    Inspector Raglan. I pulled up, and the inspector mounted on the step.</p>
<p>“Good-morning, Dr. Sheppard,” he said. “Well, that alibi is all right
    enough.”</p>
<p>“Charles Kent’s?”</p>
<p>“Charles Kent’s. The barmaid at the Dog and Whistle, Sally Jones, she
    remembers him perfectly. Picked out his photograph from among five
    others. It was just a quarter to ten when he came into the bar, and the
    Dog and Whistle is well over a mile from Fernly Park. The girl mentions
    that he had a lot of money on him—she saw him take a handful of notes
    out of his pocket. Rather surprised her, it did, seeing the class of
    fellow he was, with a pair of boots clean dropping off him. That’s
    where that forty pounds went right enough.”</p>
<p>“The man still refuses to give an account of his visit to Fernly?”</p>
<p>“Obstinate as a mule he is. I had a chat with Hayes at Liverpool over
    the wire this morning.”</p>
<p>“Hercule Poirot says he knows the reason the man went there that
    night,” I observed.</p>
<p>“Does he?” cried the inspector eagerly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>
<p>“Yes,” I said maliciously. “He says he went there because he was born
    in Kent.”</p>
<p>I felt a distinct pleasure in passing on my own discomfiture.</p>
<p>Raglan stared at me for a moment or two uncomprehendingly. Then a
    grin overspread his weaselly countenance and he tapped his forehead
    significantly.</p>
<p>“Bit gone here,” he said. “I’ve thought so for some time. Poor old
    chap, so that’s why he had to give up and come down here. In the
    family, very likely. He’s got a nephew who’s quite off his crumpet.”</p>
<p>“Poirot has?” I said, very surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes. Hasn’t he ever mentioned him to you? Quite docile, I believe, and
    all that, but mad as a hatter, poor lad.”</p>
<p>“Who told you that?”</p>
<p>Again a grin showed itself on Inspector Raglan’s face.</p>
<p>“Your sister, Miss Sheppard, she told me all about it.”</p>
<p>Really, Caroline is amazing. She never rests until she knows the last
    details of everybody’s family secrets. Unfortunately, I have never been
    able to instill into her the decency of keeping them to herself.</p>
<p>“Jump in, inspector,” I said, opening the door of the car. “We’ll go
    up to The Larches together, and acquaint our Belgian friend with the
    latest news.”</p>
<p>“Might as well, I suppose. After all, even if he is a bit balmy, it was
    a useful tip he gave me about those fingerprints. He’s got a bee in his
    bonnet about the man Kent, but who knows—there may be something useful
    behind it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>
<p>Poirot received us with his usual smiling courtesy.</p>
<p>He listened to the information we had brought him, nodding his head now
    and then.</p>
<p>“Seems quite O.K., doesn’t it?” said the inspector rather gloomily. “A
    chap can’t be murdering some one in one place when he’s drinking in the
    bar in another place a mile away.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to release him?”</p>
<p>“Don’t see what else we can do. We can’t very well hold him for
    obtaining money on false pretences. Can’t prove a ruddy thing.”</p>
<p>The inspector tossed a match into the grate in a disgruntled fashion.
    Poirot retrieved it and put it neatly in a little receptacle designed
    for the purpose. His action was purely mechanical. I could see that his
    thoughts were on something very different.</p>
<p>“If I were you,” he said at last, “I should not release the man Charles
    Kent yet.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Raglan stared at him.</p>
<p>“What I say. I should not release him yet.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think he can have had anything to do with the murder, do
    you?”</p>
<p>“I think probably not—but one cannot be certain yet.”</p>
<p>“But haven’t I just told you——”</p>
<p>Poirot raised a hand protestingly.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Mais oui, mais oui.</i> I heard. I am not deaf—nor stupid, thank
    the good God! But see you, you approach the matter from the wrong—the
    wrong—premises, is not that the word?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>
<p>The inspector stared at him heavily.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how you make that out. Look here, we know Mr. Ackroyd was
    alive at a quarter to ten. You admit that, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Poirot looked at him for a moment, then shook his head with a quick
    smile.</p>
<p>“I admit nothing that is not—<em>proved</em>!”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve got proof enough of that. We’ve got Miss Flora Ackroyd’s
    evidence.”</p>
<p>“That she said good-night to her uncle? But me—I do not always believe
    what a young lady tells me—no, not even when she is charming and
    beautiful.”</p>
<p>“But hang it all, man, Parker saw her coming out of the door.”</p>
<p>“No.” Poirot’s voice rang out with sudden sharpness. “That is just what
    he did not see. I satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the
    other day—you remember, doctor? Parker saw her <em>outside</em> the door,
    with her hand on the handle. He did not see her come out of the room.”</p>
<p>“But—where else could she have been?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps on the stairs.”</p>
<p>“The stairs?”</p>
<p>“That is my little idea—yes.”</p>
<p>“But those stairs only lead to Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Precisely.”</p>
<p>And still the inspector stared.</p>
<p>“You think she’d been up to her uncle’s bedroom? Well, why not? Why
    should she lie about it?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>
<p>“Ah! that is just the question. It depends on what she was doing there,
    does it not?”</p>
<p>“You mean—the money? Hang it all, you don’t suggest that it was Miss
    Ackroyd who took that forty pounds?”</p>
<p>“I suggest nothing,” said Poirot. “But I will remind you of this. Life
    was not very easy for that mother and daughter. There were bills—there
    was constant trouble over small sums of money. Roger Ackroyd was a
    peculiar man over money matters. The girl might be at her wit’s end for
    a comparatively small sum. Figure to yourself then what happens. She
    has taken the money, she descends the little staircase. When she is
    half-way down she hears the chink of glass from the hall. She has not a
    doubt of what it is—Parker coming to the study. At all costs she must
    not be found on the stairs—Parker will not forget it, he will think it
    odd. If the money is missed, Parker is sure to remember having seen her
    come down those stairs. She has just time to rush down to the study
    door—with her hand on the handle to show that she has just come out,
    when Parker appears in the doorway. She says the first thing that comes
    into her head, a repetition of Roger Ackroyd’s orders earlier in the
    evening, and then goes upstairs to her own room.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but later,” persisted the inspector, “she must have realized the
    vital importance of speaking the truth? Why, the whole case hinges on
    it!”</p>
<p>“Afterwards,” said Poirot dryly, “it was a little difficult for
    Mademoiselle Flora. She is told simply that the police are here and
    that there has been a robbery. Naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span> she jumps to the conclusion
    that the theft of the money has been discovered. Her one idea is to
    stick to her story. When she learns that her uncle is dead she is
    panic-stricken. Young women do not faint nowadays, monsieur, without
    considerable provocation. <i lang="fr">Eh bien!</i> there it is. She is bound to
    stick to her story, or else confess everything. And a young and pretty
    girl does not like to admit that she is a thief—especially before those
    whose esteem she is anxious to retain.”</p>
<p>Raglan brought his fist down with a thump on the table.</p>
<p>“I’ll not believe it,” he said. “It’s—it’s not credible. And you—you’ve
    known this all along?”</p>
<p>“The possibility has been in my mind from the first,” admitted Poirot.
    “I was always convinced that Mademoiselle Flora was hiding something
    from us. To satisfy myself, I made the little experiment I told you of.
    Dr. Sheppard accompanied me.”</p>
<p>“A test for Parker, you said it was,” I remarked bitterly.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon ami</i>,” said Poirot apologetically, “as I told you at the
    time, one must say something.”</p>
<p>The inspector rose.</p>
<p>“There’s only one thing for it,” he declared. “We must tackle the young
    lady right away. You’ll come up to Fernly with me, M. Poirot?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Dr. Sheppard will drive us up in his car.”</p>
<p>I acquiesced willingly.</p>
<p>On inquiry for Miss Ackroyd, we were shown into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> billiard room.
    Flora and Major Hector Blunt were sitting on the long window seat.</p>
<p>“Good-morning, Miss Ackroyd,” said the inspector. “Can we have a word
    or two alone with you?”</p>
<p>Blunt got up at once and moved to the door.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Flora nervously. “Don’t go, Major Blunt. He can
    stay, can’t he?” she asked, turning to the inspector.</p>
<p>“That’s as you like,” said the inspector dryly. “There’s a question
    or two it’s my duty to put to you, miss, but I’d prefer to do so
    privately, and I dare say you’d prefer it also.”</p>
<p>Flora looked keenly at him. I saw her face grow whiter. Then she turned
    and spoke to Blunt.</p>
<p>“I want you to stay—please—yes, I mean it. Whatever the inspector has
    to say to me, I’d rather you heard it.”</p>
<p>Raglan shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well, if you will have it so, that’s all there is to it. Now, Miss
    Ackroyd, M. Poirot here has made a certain suggestion to me. He
    suggests that you weren’t in the study at all last Friday night, that
    you never saw Mr. Ackroyd to say good-night to him, that instead of
    being in the study you were on the stairs leading down from your
    uncle’s bedroom when you heard Parker coming across the hall.”</p>
<p>Flora’s gaze shifted to Poirot. He nodded back at her.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, the other day, when we sat round the table, I implored
    you to be frank with me. What one does not tell to Papa Poirot he finds
    out. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> that, was it not? See, I will make it easy for you. You
    took the money, did you not?”</p>
<p>“The money,” said Blunt sharply.</p>
<p>There was a silence which lasted for at least a minute.</p>
<p>Then Flora drew herself up and spoke.</p>
<p>“M. Poirot is right. I took that money. I stole. I am a thief—yes, a
    common, vulgar little thief. Now you know! I am glad it has come out.
    It’s been a nightmare, these last few days!” She sat down suddenly and
    buried her face in her hands. She spoke huskily through her fingers.
    “You don’t know what my life has been since I came here. Wanting
    things, scheming for them, lying, cheating, running up bills, promising
    to pay—oh! I hate myself when I think of it all! That’s what brought us
    together, Ralph and I. We were both weak! I understood him, and I was
    sorry—because I’m the same underneath. We’re not strong enough to stand
    alone, either of us. We’re weak, miserable, despicable things.”</p>
<p>She looked at Blunt and suddenly stamped her foot.</p>
<p>“Why do you look at me like that—as though you couldn’t believe? I may
    be a thief—but at any rate I’m real now. I’m not lying any more. I’m
    not pretending to be the kind of girl you like, young and innocent and
    simple. I don’t care if you never want to see me again. I hate myself,
    despise myself—but you’ve got to believe one thing, if speaking the
    truth would have made things better for Ralph, I would have spoken out.
    But I’ve seen all along that it wouldn’t be better for Ralph—it makes
    the case against him blacker than ever. I was not doing him any harm by
    sticking to my lie.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>
<p>“Ralph,” said Blunt. “I see—always Ralph.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” said Flora hopelessly. “You never will.”</p>
<p>She turned to the inspector.</p>
<p>“I admit everything; I was at my wit’s end for money. I never saw my
    uncle that evening after he left the dinner-table. As to the money, you
    can take what steps you please. Nothing could be worse than it is now!”</p>
<p>Suddenly she broke down again, hid her face in her hands, and rushed
    from the room.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the inspector in a flat tone, “so that’s that.”</p>
<p>He seemed rather at a loss what to do next.</p>
<p>Blunt came forward.</p>
<p>“Inspector Raglan,” he said quietly, “that money was given to me by Mr.
    Ackroyd for a special purpose. Miss Ackroyd never touched it. When she
    says she did, she is lying with the idea of shielding Captain Paton.
    The truth is as I said, and I am prepared to go into the witness box
    and swear to it.”</p>
<p>He made a kind of jerky bow, then turning abruptly, he left the room.</p>
<p>Poirot was after him in a flash. He caught the other up in the hall.</p>
<p>“Monsieur—a moment, I beg of you, if you will be so good.”</p>
<p>“Well, sir?”</p>
<p>Blunt was obviously impatient. He stood frowning down on Poirot.</p>
<p>“It is this,” said Poirot rapidly: “I am not deceived by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> your little
    fantasy. No, indeed. It was truly Miss Flora who took the money. All
    the same it is well imagined what you say—it pleases me. It is very
    good what you have done there. You are a man quick to think and to act.”</p>
<p>“I’m not in the least anxious for your opinion, thank you,” said Blunt
    coldly.</p>
<p>He made once more as though to pass on, but Poirot, not at all
    offended, laid a detaining hand on his arm.</p>
<p>“Ah! but you are to listen to me. I have more to say. The other day I
    spoke of concealments. Very well, all along have I seen what you are
    concealing. Mademoiselle Flora, you love her with all your heart. From
    the first moment you saw her, is it not so? Oh! let us not mind saying
    these things—why must one in England think it necessary to mention
    love as though it were some disgraceful secret? You love Mademoiselle
    Flora. You seek to conceal that fact from all the world. That is very
    good—that is as it should be. But take the advice of Hercule Poirot—do
    not conceal it from mademoiselle herself.”</p>
<p>Blunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst Poirot was
    speaking, but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention.</p>
<p>“What d’you mean by that?” he said sharply.</p>
<p>“You think that she loves the Capitaine Ralph Paton—but I, Hercule
    Poirot, tell you that that is not so. Mademoiselle Flora accepted
    Captain Paton to please her uncle, and because she saw in the marriage
    a way of escape from her life here which was becoming frankly
    insupportable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> to her. She liked him, and there was much sympathy
    and understanding between them. But love—no! It is not Captain Paton
    Mademoiselle Flora loves.”</p>
<p>“What the devil do you mean?” asked Blunt.</p>
<p>I saw the dark flush under his tan.</p>
<p>“You have been blind, monsieur. Blind! She is loyal, the little one.
    Ralph Paton is under a cloud, she is bound in honor to stick by him.”</p>
<p>I felt it was time I put in a word to help on the good work.</p>
<p>“My sister told me the other night,” I said encouragingly, “that Flora
    had never cared a penny piece for Ralph Paton, and never would. My
    sister is always right about these things.”</p>
<p>Blunt ignored my well-meant efforts. He spoke to Poirot.</p>
<p>“D’you really think——” he began, and stopped.</p>
<p>He is one of those inarticulate men who find it hard to put things into
    words.</p>
<p>Poirot knows no such disability.</p>
<p>“If you doubt me, ask her yourself, monsieur. But perhaps you no longer
    care to—the affair of the money——”</p>
<p>Blunt gave a sound like an angry laugh.</p>
<p>“Think I’d hold that against her? Roger was always a queer chap about
    money. She got in a mess and didn’t dare tell him. Poor kid. Poor
    lonely kid.”</p>
<p>Poirot looked thoughtfully at the side door.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle Flora went into the garden, I think,” he murmured.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>
<p>“I’ve been every kind of a fool,” said Blunt abruptly. “Rum
    conversation we’ve been having. Like one of those Danish plays. But
    you’re a sound fellow, M. Poirot. Thank you.”</p>
<p>He took Poirot’s hand and gave it a grip which caused the other to
    wince in anguish. Then he strode to the side door and passed out into
    the garden.</p>
<p>“Not every kind of a fool,” murmured Poirot, tenderly nursing the
    injured member. “Only one kind—the fool in love.”</p>

<div class="subhead">MISS RUSSELL</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Inspector Raglan</span> had received a bad jolt. He was not deceived by
    Blunt’s valiant lie any more than we had been. Our way back to the
    village was punctuated by his complaints.</p>
<p>“This alters everything, this does. I don’t know whether you’ve
    realized it, Monsieur Poirot?”</p>
<p>“I think so, yes, I think so,” said Poirot. “You see, me, I have been
    familiar with the idea for some time.”</p>
<p>Inspector Raglan, who had only had the idea presented to him a short
    half-hour ago, looked at Poirot unhappily, and went on with his
    discoveries.</p>
<p>“Those alibis now. Worthless! Absolutely worthless. Got to start
    again. Find out what every one was doing from nine-thirty onwards.
    Nine-thirty—that’s the time we’ve got to hang on to. You were quite
    right about the man Kent—we don’t release <em>him</em> yet awhile. Let
    me see now—nine-forty-five at the Dog and Whistle. He might have got
    there in a quarter of an hour if he ran. It’s just possible that it was
    <em>his</em> voice Mr. Raymond heard talking to Mr. Ackroyd—asking for
    money which Mr. Ackroyd refused. But one thing’s clear—it wasn’t he who
    sent the telephone message. The station is half a mile in the other
    direction—over a mile and a half from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span> the Dog and Whistle, and he was
    at the Dog and Whistle until about ten minutes past ten. Dang that
    telephone call! We always come up against it.”</p>
<p>“We do indeed,” agreed Poirot. “It is curious.”</p>
<p>“It’s just possible that if Captain Paton climbed into his uncle’s room
    and found him there murdered, <em>he</em> may have sent it. Got the wind
    up, thought he’d be accused, and cleared out. That’s possible, isn’t
    it?”</p>
<p>“Why should he have telephoned?”</p>
<p>“May have had doubts if the old man was really dead. Thought he’d
    get the doctor up there as soon as possible, but didn’t want to give
    himself away. Yes, I say now, how’s that for a theory? Something in
    that, I should say.”</p>
<p>The inspector swelled his chest out importantly. He was so plainly
    delighted with himself that any words of ours would have been quite
    superfluous.</p>
<p>We arrived back at my house at this minute, and I hurried in to my
    surgery patients, who had all been waiting a considerable time, leaving
    Poirot to walk to the police station with the inspector.</p>
<p>Having dismissed the last patient, I strolled into the little room at
    the back of the house which I call my workshop—I am rather proud of the
    home-made wireless set I turned out. Caroline hates my workroom. I keep
    my tools there, and Annie is not allowed to wreak havoc with a dustpan
    and brush. I was just adjusting the interior of an alarm clock which
    had been denounced as wholly unreliable by the household, when the door
    opened and Caroline put her head in.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>
<p>“Oh! there you are, James,” she said, with deep disapproval. “M. Poirot
    wants to see you.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, rather irritably, for her sudden entrance had startled
    me and I had let go of a piece of delicate mechanism, “if he wants to
    see me, he can come in here.”</p>
<p>“In here?” said Caroline.</p>
<p>“That’s what I said—in here.”</p>
<p>Caroline gave a sniff of disapproval and retired. She returned in a
    moment or two, ushering in Poirot, and then retired again, shutting the
    door with a bang.</p>
<p>“Aha! my friend,” said Poirot, coming forward and rubbing his hands.
    “You have not got rid of me so easily, you see!”</p>
<p>“Finished with the inspector?” I asked.</p>
<p>“For the moment, yes. And you, you have seen all the patients?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Poirot sat down and looked at me, tilting his egg-shaped head on one
    side, with the air of one who savors a very delicious joke.</p>
<p>“You are in error,” he said at last. “You have still one patient to
    see.”</p>
<p>“Not you?” I exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>“Ah, not me, <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>. Me, I have the health magnificent.
    No, to tell you the truth, it is a little <i lang="fr">complot</i> of mine. There
    is some one I wish to see, you understand—and at the same time it is
    not necessary that the whole village should intrigue itself about the
    matter—which is what would happen if the lady were seen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span> come to my
    house—for it is a lady. But to you she has already come as a patient
    before.”</p>
<p>“Miss Russell!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Précisément.</i> I wish much to speak with her, so I send her the
    little note and make the appointment in your surgery. You are not
    annoyed with me?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary,” I said. “That is, presuming I am allowed to be
    present at the interview?”</p>
<p>“But naturally! In your own surgery!”</p>
<p>“You know,” I said, throwing down the pincers I was holding, “it’s
    extraordinarily intriguing, the whole thing. Every new development that
    arises is like the shake you give to a kaleidoscope—the thing changes
    entirely in aspect. Now, why are you so anxious to see Miss Russell?”</p>
<p>Poirot raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Surely it is obvious?” he murmured.</p>
<p>“There you go again,” I grumbled. “According to you everything is
    obvious. But you leave me walking about in a fog.”</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head genially at me.</p>
<p>“You mock yourself at me. Take the matter of Mademoiselle Flora. The
    inspector was surprised—but you—you were not.”</p>
<p>“I never dreamed of her being the thief,” I expostulated.</p>
<p>“That—perhaps no. But I was watching your face and you were not—like
    Inspector Raglan—startled and incredulous.”</p>
<p>I thought for a minute or two.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>
<p>“Perhaps you are right,” I said at last. “All along I’ve felt that
    Flora was keeping back something—so the truth, when it came, was
    subconsciously expected. It upset Inspector Raglan very much indeed,
    poor man.”</p>
<p>“Ah! <i lang="fr">pour ça, oui</i>! The poor man must rearrange all his ideas.
    I profited by his state of mental chaos to induce him to grant me a
    little favor.”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>Poirot took a sheet of notepaper from his pocket. Some words were
    written on it, and he read them aloud.</p>
<p>“The police have, for some days, been seeking for Captain Ralph Paton,
    the nephew of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park, whose death occurred under
    such tragic circumstances last Friday. Captain Paton has been found at
    Liverpool, where he was on the point of embarking for America.”</p>
<p>He folded up the piece of paper again.</p>
<p>“That, my friend, will be in the newspapers to-morrow morning.”</p>
<p>I stared at him, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“But—but it isn’t true! He’s not at Liverpool!”</p>
<p>Poirot beamed on me.</p>
<p>“You have the intelligence so quick! No, he has not been found at
    Liverpool. Inspector Raglan was very loath to let me send this
    paragraph to the press, especially as I could not take him into my
    confidence. But I assured him most solemnly that very interesting
    results would follow its appearance in print, so he gave in, after
    stipulating that he was, on no account, to bear the responsibility.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>
<p>I stared at Poirot. He smiled back at me.</p>
<p>“It beats me,” I said at last, “what you expect to get out of that.”</p>
<p>“You should employ your little gray cells,” said Poirot gravely.</p>
<p>He rose and came across to the bench.</p>
<p>“It is that you have really the love of the machinery,” he said, after
    inspecting the débris of my labors.</p>
<p>Every man has his hobby. I immediately drew Poirot’s attention to my
    home-made wireless. Finding him sympathetic, I showed him one or two
    little inventions of my own—trifling things, but useful in the house.</p>
<p>“Decidedly,” said Poirot, “you should be an inventor by trade, not a
    doctor. But I hear the bell—that is your patient. Let us go into the
    surgery.”</p>
<p>Once before I had been struck by the remnants of beauty in the
    housekeeper’s face. This morning I was struck anew. Very simply dressed
    in black, tall, upright and independent as ever, with her big dark eyes
    and an unwonted flush of color in her usually pale cheeks, I realized
    that as a girl she must have been startlingly handsome.</p>
<p>“Good-morning, mademoiselle,” said Poirot. “Will you be seated? Dr.
    Sheppard is so kind as to permit me the use of his surgery for a little
    conversation I am anxious to have with you.”</p>
<p>Miss Russell sat down with her usual composure. If she felt any inward
    agitation, it did not display itself in any outward manifestation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>
<p>“It seems a queer way of doing things, if you’ll allow me to say so,”
    she remarked.</p>
<p>“Miss Russell—I have news to give you.”</p>
<p>“Indeed!”</p>
<p>“Charles Kent has been arrested at Liverpool.”</p>
<p>Not a muscle of her face moved. She merely opened her eyes a trifle
    wider, and asked, with a tinge of defiance:</p>
<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>
<p>But at that moment it came to me—the resemblance that had haunted me
    all along, something familiar in the defiance of Charles Kent’s manner.
    The two voices, one rough and coarse, the other painfully ladylike—were
    strangely the same in timbre. It was of Miss Russell that I had been
    reminded that night outside the gates of Fernly Park.</p>
<p>I looked at Poirot, full of my discovery, and he gave me an
    imperceptible nod.</p>
<p>In answer to Miss Russell’s question, he threw out his hands in a
    thoroughly French gesture.</p>
<p>“I thought you might be interested, that is all,” he said mildly.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not particularly,” said Miss Russell. “Who is this Charles
    Kent anyway?”</p>
<p>“He is a man, mademoiselle, who was at Fernly on the night of the
    murder.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Fortunately for him, he has an alibi. At a quarter to ten he was at a
    public-house a mile from here.”</p>
<p>“Lucky for him,” commented Miss Russell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>
<p>“But we still do not know what he was doing at Fernly—who it was he
    went to meet, for instance.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I can’t help you at all,” said the housekeeper politely.
    “Nothing came to <em>my</em> ears. If that is all——”</p>
<p>She made a tentative movement as though to rise. Poirot stopped her.</p>
<p>“It is not quite all,” he said smoothly. “This morning fresh
    developments have arisen. It seems now that Mr. Ackroyd was murdered,
    not at a quarter to ten, but <em>before</em>. Between ten minutes to
    nine, when Dr. Sheppard left, and a quarter to ten.”</p>
<p>I saw the color drain from the housekeeper’s face, leaving it dead
    white. She leaned forward, her figure swaying.</p>
<p>“But Miss Ackroyd said—Miss Ackroyd said——”</p>
<p>“Miss Ackroyd has admitted that she was lying. She was never in the
    study at all that evening.”</p>
<p>“Then——?”</p>
<p>“Then it would seem that in this Charles Kent we have the man we are
    looking for. He came to Fernly, can give no account of what he was
    doing there——”</p>
<p>“I can tell you what he was doing there. He never touched a hair of old
    Ackroyd’s head—he never went near the study. He didn’t do it, I tell
    you.”</p>
<p>She was leaning forward. That iron self-control was broken through at
    last. Terror and desperation were in her face.</p>
<p>“M. Poirot! M. Poirot! Oh, do believe me.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>
<p>Poirot got up and came to her. He patted her reassuringly on the
    shoulder.</p>
<p>“But yes—but yes, I will believe. I had to make you speak, you know.”</p>
<p>For an instant suspicion flared up in her.</p>
<p>“Is what you said true?”</p>
<p>“That Charles Kent is suspected of the crime? Yes, that is true. You
    alone can save him, by telling the reason for his being at Fernly.”</p>
<p>“He came to see me.” She spoke in a low, hurried voice. “I went out to
    meet him——”</p>
<p>“In the summer-house, yes, I know.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, it is the business of Hercule Poirot to know things. I
    know that you went out earlier in the evening, that you left a message
    in the summer-house to say what time you would be there.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did. I had heard from him—saying he was coming. I dared not
    let him come to the house. I wrote to the address he gave me and said
    I would meet him in the summer-house, and described it to him so that
    he would be able to find it. Then I was afraid he might not wait there
    patiently, and I ran out and left a piece of paper to say I would be
    there about ten minutes past nine. I didn’t want the servants to see
    me, so I slipped out through the drawing-room window. As I came back, I
    met Dr. Sheppard, and I fancied that he would think it queer. I was out
    of breath, for I had been running. I had no idea that he was expected
    to dinner that night.”</p>
<p>She paused.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p>
<p>“Go on,” said Poirot. “You went out to meet him at ten minutes past
    nine. What did you say to each other?”</p>
<p>“It’s difficult. You see——”</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, interrupting her, “in this matter I must
    have the whole truth. What you tell us need never go beyond these four
    walls. Dr. Sheppard will be discreet, and so shall I. See, I will help
    you. This Charles Kent, he is your son, is he not?”</p>
<p>She nodded. The color had flamed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>“No one has ever known. It was long ago—long ago—down in Kent. I was
    not married....”</p>
<p>“So you took the name of the county as a surname for him. I understand.”</p>
<p>“I got work. I managed to pay for his board and lodging. I never told
    him that I was his mother. But he turned out badly, he drank, then took
    to drugs. I managed to pay his passage out to Canada. I didn’t hear of
    him for a year or two. Then, somehow or other, he found out that I was
    his mother. He wrote asking me for money. Finally, I heard from him
    back in this country again. He was coming to see me at Fernly, he said.
    I dared not let him come to the house. I have always been considered
    so—so very respectable. If any one got an inkling—it would have been
    all up with my post as housekeeper. So I wrote to him in the way I have
    just told you.”</p>
<p>“And in the morning you came to see Dr. Sheppard?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I wondered if something could be done. He was not a bad
    boy—before he took to drugs.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>
<p>“I see,” said Poirot. “Now let us go on with the story. He came that
    night to the summer-house?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he was waiting for me when I got there. He was very rough and
    abusive. I had brought with me all the money I had, and I gave it to
    him. We talked a little, and then he went away.”</p>
<p>“What time was that?”</p>
<p>“It must have been between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine. It
    was not yet half-past when I got back to the house.”</p>
<p>“Which way did he go?”</p>
<p>“Straight out the same way he came, by the path that joined the drive
    just inside the lodge gates.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“And you, what did you do?”</p>
<p>“I went back to the house. Major Blunt was walking up and down the
    terrace smoking, so I made a detour to get round to the side door. It
    was then just on half-past nine, as I tell you.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded again. He made a note or two in a microscopic pocket-book.</p>
<p>“I think that is all,” he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Ought I——” she hesitated. “Ought I to tell all this to Inspector
    Raglan?”</p>
<p>“It may come to that. But let us not be in a hurry. Let us proceed
    slowly, with due order and method. Charles Kent is not yet formally
    charged with murder. Circumstances may arise which will render your
    story unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Miss Russell rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>
<p>“Thank you very much, M. Poirot,” she said. “You have been very
    kind—very kind indeed. You—you do believe me, don’t you? That Charles
    had nothing to do with this wicked murder!”</p>
<p>“There seems no doubt that the man who was talking to Mr. Ackroyd in
    the library at nine-thirty could not possibly have been your son. Be of
    good courage, mademoiselle. All will yet be well.”</p>
<p>Miss Russell departed. Poirot and I were left together.</p>
<p>“So that’s that,” I said. “Every time we come back to Ralph Paton. How
    did you manage to spot Miss Russell as the person Charles Kent came to
    meet? Did you notice the resemblance?”</p>
<p>“I had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually
    came face to face with him. As soon as we found that quill. The quill
    suggested dope, and I remembered your account of Miss Russell’s visit
    to you. Then I found the article on cocaine in that morning’s paper. It
    all seemed very clear. She had heard from some one that morning—some
    one addicted to drugs, she read the article in the paper, and she came
    to you to ask a few tentative questions. She mentioned cocaine, since
    the article in question was on cocaine. Then, when you seemed too
    interested, she switched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories
    and untraceable poisons. I suspected a son or a brother, or some other
    undesirable male relation. Ah! but I must go. It is the time of the
    lunch.”</p>
<p>“Stay and lunch with us,” I suggested.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>
<p>Poirot shook his head. A faint twinkle came into his eye.</p>
<p>“Not again to-day. I should not like to force Mademoiselle Caroline to
    adopt a vegetarian diet two days in succession.”</p>
<p>It occurred to me that there was not much which escaped Hercule Poirot.</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">THE PARAGRAPH IN THE PAPER</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Caroline</span>, of course, had not failed to see Miss Russell come
    to the surgery door. I had anticipated this, and had ready an
    elaborate account of the lady’s bad knee. But Caroline was not in a
    cross-questioning mood. Her point of view was that she knew what Miss
    Russell had really come for and that <em>I</em> didn’t.</p>
<p>“Pumping you, James,” said Caroline. “Pumping you in the most shameless
    manner, I’ve not a doubt. It’s no good interrupting. I dare say you
    hadn’t the least idea she was doing it even. Men <em>are</em> so simple.
    She knows that you are in M. Poirot’s confidence, and she wants to find
    out things. Do you know what I think, James?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t begin to imagine. You think so many extraordinary things.”</p>
<p>“It’s no good being sarcastic. I think Miss Russell knows more about
    Mr. Ackroyd’s death than she is prepared to admit.”</p>
<p>Caroline leaned back triumphantly in her chair.</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?” I said absently.</p>
<p>“You are very dull to-day, James. No animation about you. It’s that
    liver of yours.”</p>
<p>Our conversation then dealt with purely personal matters.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>
<p>The paragraph inspired by Poirot duly appeared in our daily paper the
    next morning. I was in the dark as to its purpose, but its effect on
    Caroline was immense.</p>
<p>She began by stating, most untruly, that she had said as much all
    along. I raised my eyebrows, but did not argue. Caroline, however, must
    have felt a prick of conscience, for she went on:—</p>
<p>“I mayn’t have actually mentioned Liverpool, but I knew he’d try to get
    away to America. That’s what Crippen did.”</p>
<p>“Without much success,” I reminded her.</p>
<p>“Poor boy, and so they’ve caught him. I consider, James, that it’s your
    duty to see that he isn’t hung.”</p>
<p>“What do you expect me to do?”</p>
<p>“Why, you’re a medical man, aren’t you? You’ve known him from a boy
    upwards. Not mentally responsible. That’s the line to take, clearly. I
    read only the other day that they’re very happy in Broadmoor—it’s quite
    like a high-class club.”</p>
<p>But Caroline’s words had reminded me of something.</p>
<p>“I never knew that Poirot had an imbecile nephew?” I said curiously.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you? Oh, he told me all about it. Poor lad. It’s a great grief
    to all the family. They’ve kept him at home so far, but it’s getting
    to such a pitch that they’re afraid he’ll have to go into some kind of
    institution.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about
    Poirot’s family by this time,” I said, exasperated.</p>
<p>“Pretty well,” said Caroline complacently. “It’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> great relief to
    people to be able to tell all their troubles to some one.”</p>
<p>“It might be,” I said, “if they were ever allowed to do so
    spontaneously. Whether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of
    them by force is another matter.”</p>
<p>Caroline merely looked at me with the air of a Christian martyr
    enjoying martyrdom.</p>
<p>“You are so self-contained, James,” she said. “You hate speaking out,
    or parting with any information yourself, and you think everybody else
    must be just like you. I should hope that I never screw confidences out
    of anybody. For instance, if M. Poirot comes in this afternoon, as he
    said he might do, I shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at
    his house early this morning.”</p>
<p>“Early this morning?” I queried.</p>
<p>“Very early,” said Caroline. “Before the milk came. I just happened
    to be looking out of the window—the blind was flapping. It was a man.
    He came in a closed car, and he was all muffled up. I couldn’t get a
    glimpse of his face. But I will tell you <em>my</em> idea, and you’ll see
    that I’m right.”</p>
<p>“What’s your idea?”</p>
<p>Caroline dropped her voice mysteriously.</p>
<p>“A Home Office expert,” she breathed.</p>
<p>“A Home Office expert,” I said, amazed. “My dear Caroline!”</p>
<p>“Mark my words, James, you’ll see that I’m right. That Russell woman
    was here that morning after your poisons. Roger Ackroyd might easily
    have been poisoned in his food that night.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>
<p>I laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” I cried. “He was stabbed in the neck. You know that as well
    as I do.”</p>
<p>“After death, James,” said Caroline; “to make a false clew.”</p>
<p>“My good woman,” I said, “I examined the body, and I know what I’m
    talking about. That wound wasn’t inflicted after death—it was the cause
    of death, and you need make no mistake about it.”</p>
<p>Caroline merely continued to look omniscient, which so annoyed me that
    I went on:—</p>
<p>“Perhaps you will tell me, Caroline, if I have a medical degree or if I
    have not?”</p>
<p>“You have the medical degree, I dare say, James—at least, I mean I know
    you have. But you’ve no imagination whatever.”</p>
<p>“Having endowed you with a treble portion, there was none left over for
    me,” I said dryly.</p>
<p>I was amused to notice Caroline’s maneuvers that afternoon when Poirot
    duly arrived. My sister, without asking a direct question, skirted the
    subject of the mysterious guest in every way imaginable. By the twinkle
    in Poirot’s eyes, I saw that he realized her object. He remained
    blandly impervious, and blocked her bowling so successfully that she
    herself was at a loss how to proceed.</p>
<p>Having, I suspect, quietly enjoyed the little game, he rose to his feet
    and suggested a walk.</p>
<p>“It is that I need to reduce the figure a little,” he explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> “You
    will come with me, doctor? And perhaps later Miss Caroline will give us
    some tea.”</p>
<p>“Delighted,” said Caroline. “Won’t your—er—guest come in also?”</p>
<p>“You are too kind,” said Poirot. “But no, my friend reposes himself.
    Soon you must make his acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Quite an old friend of yours, so somebody told me,” said Caroline,
    making one last valiant effort.</p>
<p>“Did they?” murmured Poirot “Well, we must start.”</p>
<p>Our tramp took us in the direction of Fernly. I had guessed beforehand
    that it might do so. I was beginning to understand Poirot’s methods.
    Every little irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole.</p>
<p>“I have a commission for you, my friend,” he said at last. “To-night,
    at my house, I desire to have a little conference. You will attend,
    will you not?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” I said.</p>
<p>“Good. I need also all those in the house—that is to say: Mrs. Ackroyd,
    Mademoiselle Flora, Major Blunt, M. Raymond. I want you to be my
    ambassador. This little reunion is fixed for nine o’clock. You will ask
    them—yes?”</p>
<p>“With pleasure; but why not ask them yourself?”</p>
<p>“Because they will then put the questions: Why? What for? They will
    demand what my idea is. And, as you know, my friend, I much dislike to
    have to explain my little ideas until the time comes.”</p>
<p>I smiled a little.</p>
<p>“My friend Hastings, he of whom I told you, used to say of me that I
    was the human oyster. But he was unjust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> Of facts, I keep nothing to
    myself. But to every one his own interpretation of them.”</p>
<p>“When do you want me to do this?”</p>
<p>“Now, if you will. We are close to the house.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you coming in?”</p>
<p>“No, me, I will promenade myself in the grounds. I will rejoin you by
    the lodge gates in a quarter of an hour’s time.”</p>
<p>I nodded, and set off on my task. The only member of the family at home
    proved to be Mrs. Ackroyd, who was sipping an early cup of tea. She
    received me very graciously.</p>
<p>“So grateful to you, doctor,” she murmured, “for clearing up that
    little matter with M. Poirot. But life is one trouble after another.
    You have heard about Flora, of course?”</p>
<p>“What exactly?” I asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“This new engagement. Flora and Hector Blunt. Of course not such a good
    match as Ralph would have been. But after all, happiness comes first.
    What dear Flora needs is an older man—some one steady and reliable, and
    then Hector is really a very distinguished man in his way. You saw the
    news of Ralph’s arrest in the paper this morning?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, “I did.”</p>
<p>“Horrible.” Mrs. Ackroyd closed her eyes and shuddered. “Geoffrey
    Raymond was in a terrible way. Rang up Liverpool. But they wouldn’t
    tell him anything at the police station there. In fact, they said
    they hadn’t arrested Ralph at all. Mr. Raymond insists that it’s all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
    a mistake—a—what do they call it?—<em>canard</em> of the newspaper’s.
    I’ve forbidden it to be mentioned before the servants. Such a terrible
    disgrace. Fancy if Flora had actually been married to him.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd shut her eyes in anguish. I began to wonder how soon I
    should be able to deliver Poirot’s invitation.</p>
<p>Before I had time to speak, Mrs. Ackroyd was off again.</p>
<p>“You were here yesterday, weren’t you, with that dreadful Inspector
    Raglan? Brute of a man—he terrified Flora into saying she took that
    money from poor Roger’s room. And the matter was so simple, really. The
    dear child wanted to borrow a few pounds, didn’t like to disturb her
    uncle since he’d given strict orders against it, but knowing where he
    kept his notes she went there and took what she needed.”</p>
<p>“Is that Flora’s account of the matter?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My dear doctor, you know what girls are nowadays. So easily acted on
    by suggestion. You, of course, know all about hypnosis and that sort of
    thing. The inspector shouts at her, says the word ‘steal’ over and over
    again, until the poor child gets an inhibition—or is it a complex?—I
    always mix up those two words—and actually thinks herself that she has
    stolen the money. I saw at once how it was. But I can’t be too thankful
    for the whole misunderstanding in one way—it seems to have brought
    those two together—Hector and Flora, I mean. And I assure you that I
    have been very much worried about Flora in the past: why, at one time
    I actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> thought there was going to be some kind of understanding
    between her and young Raymond. Just think of it!” Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice
    rose in shrill horror. “A private secretary—with practically no means
    of his own.”</p>
<p>“It would have been a severe blow to you,” I said. “Now, Mrs. Ackroyd,
    I’ve got a message for you from M. Hercule Poirot.”</p>
<p>“For me?”</p>
<p>Mrs. Ackroyd looked quite alarmed.</p>
<p>I hastened to reassure her, and I explained what Poirot wanted.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Ackroyd rather doubtfully, “I suppose we must
    come if M. Poirot says so. But what is it all about? I like to know
    beforehand.”</p>
<p>I assured the lady truthfully that I myself did not know any more than
    she did.</p>
<p>“Very well,” said Mrs. Ackroyd at last, rather grudgingly, “I will tell
    the others, and we will be there at nine o’clock.”</p>
<p>Thereupon I took my leave, and joined Poirot at the agreed
    meeting-place.</p>
<p>“I’ve been longer than a quarter of an hour, I’m afraid,” I remarked.
    “But once that good lady starts talking it’s a matter of the utmost
    difficulty to get a word in edgeways.”</p>
<p>“It is of no matter,” said Poirot. “Me, I have been well amused. This
    park is magnificent.”</p>
<p>We set off homewards. When we arrived, to our great surprise Caroline,
    who had evidently been watching for us, herself opened the door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>
<p>She put her fingers to her lips. Her face was full of importance and
    excitement.</p>
<p>“Ursula Bourne,” she said, “the parlormaid from Fernly. She’s here!
    I’ve put her in the dining-room. She’s in a terrible way, poor thing.
    Says she must see M. Poirot at once. I’ve done all I could. Taken her a
    cup of hot tea. It really goes to one’s heart to see any one in such a
    state.”</p>
<p>“In the dining-room?” asked Poirot.</p>
<p>“This way,” I said, and flung open the door.</p>
<p>Ursula Bourne was sitting by the table. Her arms were spread out in
    front of her, and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it
    had been buried. Her eyes were red with weeping.</p>
<p>“Ursula Bourne,” I murmured.</p>
<p>But Poirot went past me with outstretched hands.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “that is not quite right, I think. It is not Ursula
    Bourne, is it, my child—but Ursula Paton? Mrs. Ralph Paton.”</p>

</div>
<div class="subhead">URSULA’S STORY</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment or two the girl looked mutely at Poirot. Then, her reserve
    breaking down completely, she nodded her head once, and burst into an
    outburst of sobs.</p>
<p>Caroline pushed past me, and putting her arm round the girl, patted her
    on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“There, there, my dear,” she said soothingly, “it will be all right.
    You’ll see—everything will be all right.”</p>
<p>Buried under curiosity and scandal-mongering there is a lot of kindness
    in Caroline. For the moment, even the interest of Poirot’s revelation
    was lost in the sight of the girl’s distress.</p>
<p>Presently Ursula sat up and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>“This is very weak and silly of me,” she said.</p>
<p>“No, no, my child,” said Poirot kindly. “We can all realize the strain
    of this last week.”</p>
<p>“It must have been a terrible ordeal,” I said.</p>
<p>“And then to find that you knew,” continued Ursula. “How did you know?
    Was it Ralph who told you?”</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head.</p>
<p>“You know what brought me to you to-night,” went on the girl.
    “<em>This</em>——”</p>
<p>She held out a crumpled piece of newspaper, and I recognized the
    paragraph that Poirot had had inserted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>
<p>“It says that Ralph has been arrested. So everything is useless. I need
    not pretend any longer.”</p>
<p>“Newspaper paragraphs are not always true, mademoiselle,” murmured
    Poirot, having the grace to look ashamed of himself. “All the same, I
    think you will do well to make a clean breast of things. The truth is
    what we need now.”</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, looking at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>“You do not trust me,” said Poirot gently. “Yet all the same you came
    here to find me, did you not? Why was that?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t believe that Ralph did it,” said the girl in a very
    low voice. “And I think that you are clever, and will find out the
    truth. And also——”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I think you are kind.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded his head several times.</p>
<p>“It is very good that—yes, it is very good. Listen, I do in verity
    believe that this husband of yours is innocent—but the affair marches
    badly. If I am to save him, I must know all there is to know—even if it
    should seem to make the case against him blacker than before.”</p>
<p>“How well you understand,” said Ursula.</p>
<p>“So you will tell me the whole story, will you not? From the beginning.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to send <em>me</em> away, I hope,” said Caroline,
    settling herself comfortably in an arm-chair. “What I want to know,”
    she continued, “is why this child was masquerading as a parlormaid?”</p>
<p>“Masquerading?” I queried.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>
<p>“That’s what I said. Why did you do it, child? For a wager?”</p>
<p>“For a living,” said Ursula dryly.</p>
<p>And encouraged, she began the story which I reproduce here in my own
    words.</p>
<p>Ursula Bourne, it seemed, was one of a family of seven—impoverished
    Irish gentlefolk. On the death of her father, most of the girls were
    cast out into the world to earn their own living. Ursula’s eldest
    sister was married to Captain Folliott. It was she whom I had seen
    that Sunday, and the cause of her embarrassment was clear enough now.
    Determined to earn her living and not attracted to the idea of being a
    nursery governess—the one profession open to an untrained girl, Ursula
    preferred the job of parlormaid. She scorned to label herself a “lady
    parlormaid.” She would be the real thing, her reference being supplied
    by her sister. At Fernly, despite an aloofness which, as has been seen,
    caused some comment, she was a success at her job—quick, competent, and
    thorough.</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the work,” she explained. “And I had plenty of time to
    myself.”</p>
<p>And then came her meeting with Ralph Paton, and the love affair which
    culminated in a secret marriage. Ralph had persuaded her into that,
    somewhat against her will. He had declared that his stepfather would
    not hear of his marrying a penniless girl. Better to be married
    secretly, and break the news to him at some later and more favorable
    minute.</p>
<p>And so the deed was done, and Ursula Bourne became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> Ursula Paton.
    Ralph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts, find a job, and
    then, when he was in a position to support her, and independent of his
    adopted father, they would break the news to him.</p>
<p>But to people like Ralph Paton, turning over a new leaf is easier in
    theory than in practice. He hoped that his stepfather, whilst still
    in ignorance of the marriage, might be persuaded to pay his debts and
    put him on his feet again. But the revelation of the amount of Ralph’s
    liabilities merely enraged Roger Ackroyd, and he refused to do anything
    at all. Some months passed, and then Ralph was bidden once more to
    Fernly. Roger Ackroyd did not beat about the bush. It was the desire of
    his heart that Ralph should marry Flora, and he put the matter plainly
    before the young man.</p>
<p>And here it was that the innate weakness of Ralph Paton showed itself.
    As always, he grasped at the easy, the immediate solution. As far
    as I could make out, neither Flora nor Ralph made any pretence of
    love. It was, on both sides, a business arrangement. Roger Ackroyd
    dictated his wishes—they agreed to them. Flora accepted a chance of
    liberty, money, and an enlarged horizon, Ralph, of course, was playing
    a different game. But he was in a very awkward hole financially. He
    seized at the chance. His debts would be paid. He could start again
    with a clean sheet. His was not a nature to envisage the future, but
    I gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with Flora being broken
    off after a decent interval had elapsed. Both Flora and he stipulated
    that it should be kept a secret for the present. He was anxious to
    conceal it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> Ursula. He felt instinctively that her nature, strong
    and resolute, with an inherent distaste for duplicity, was not one to
    welcome such a course.</p>
<p>Then came the crucial moment when Roger Ackroyd, always high-handed,
    decided to announce the engagement. He said no word of his intention
    to Ralph—only to Flora, and Flora, apathetic, raised no objection. On
    Ursula, the news fell like a bombshell. Summoned by her, Ralph came
    hurriedly down from town. They met in the wood, where part of their
    conversation was overheard by my sister. Ralph implored her to keep
    silent for a little while longer, Ursula was equally determined to have
    done with concealments. She would tell Mr. Ackroyd the truth without
    any further delay. Husband and wife parted acrimoniously.</p>
<p>Ursula, steadfast in her purpose, sought an interview with Roger
    Ackroyd that very afternoon, and revealed the truth to him. Their
    interview was a stormy one—it might have been even more stormy had not
    Roger Ackroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles. It was bad
    enough, however. Ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit
    that had been practiced upon him. His rancor was mainly directed to
    Ralph, but Ursula came in for her share, since he regarded her as a
    girl who had deliberately tried to “entrap” the adopted son of a very
    wealthy man. Unforgivable things were said on both sides.</p>
<p>That same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small
    summer-house, stealing out from the house by the side door in order to
    do so. Their interview was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span> made up of reproaches on both sides. Ralph
    charged Ursula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her
    ill-timed revelation. Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.</p>
<p>They parted at last. A little over half an hour later came the
    discovery of Roger Ackroyd’s body. Since that night Ursula had neither
    seen nor heard from Ralph.</p>
<p>As the story unfolded itself, I realized more and more what a damning
    series of facts it was. Alive, Ackroyd could hardly have failed to
    alter his will—I knew him well enough to realize that to do so would
    be his first thought. His death came in the nick of time for Ralph and
    Ursula Paton. Small wonder the girl had held her tongue, and played her
    part so consistently.</p>
<p>My meditations were interrupted. It was Poirot’s voice speaking, and I
    knew from the gravity of his tone that he, too, was fully alive to the
    implications of the position.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, I must ask you one question, and you must answer it
    truthfully, for on it everything may hang: What time was it when you
    parted from Captain Ralph Paton in the summer-house? Now, take a little
    minute so that your answer may be very exact.”</p>
<p>The girl gave a half laugh, bitter enough in all conscience.</p>
<p>“Do you think I haven’t gone over that again and again in my own mind?
    It was just half-past nine when I went out to meet him. Major Blunt
    was walking up and down the terrace, so I had to go round through the
    bushes to avoid him. It must have been about twenty-seven minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> to
    ten when I reached the summer-house. Ralph was waiting for me. I was
    with him ten minutes—not longer, for it was just a quarter to ten when
    I got back to the house.”</p>
<p>I saw now the insistence of her question the other day. If only Ackroyd
    could have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten, and
    not after.</p>
<p>I saw the reflection of that thought in Poirot’s next question.</p>
<p>“Who left the summer-house first?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“Leaving Ralph Paton in the summer-house?”</p>
<p>“Yes—but you don’t think——”</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, it is of no importance what I think. What did you do
    when you got back to the house?”</p>
<p>“I went up to my room.”</p>
<p>“And stayed there until when?”</p>
<p>“Until about ten o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Is there any one who can prove that?”</p>
<p>“Prove? That I was in my room, you mean? Oh! no. But surely—oh! I see,
    they might think—they might think——”</p>
<p>I saw the dawning horror in her eyes.</p>
<p>Poirot finished the sentence for her.</p>
<p>“That it was <em>you</em> who entered by the window and stabbed Mr.
    Ackroyd as he sat in his chair? Yes, they might think just that.”</p>
<p>“Nobody but a fool would think any such thing,” said Caroline
    indignantly.</p>
<p>She patted Ursula on the shoulder.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>
<p>The girl had her face hidden in her hands.</p>
<p>“Horrible,” she was murmuring. “Horrible.”</p>
<p>Caroline gave her a friendly shake.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, my dear,” she said. “M. Poirot doesn’t think that really.
    As for that husband of yours, I don’t think much of him, and I tell you
    so candidly. Running away and leaving you to face the music.”</p>
<p>But Ursula shook her head energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” she cried. “It wasn’t like that at all. Ralph would not run
    away on his own account. I see now. If he heard of his stepfather’s
    murder, he might think himself that I had done it.”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t think any such thing,” said Caroline.</p>
<p>“I was so cruel to him that night—so hard and bitter. I wouldn’t listen
    to what he was trying to say—wouldn’t believe that he really cared.
    I just stood there telling him what I thought of him, and saying the
    coldest, cruelest things that came into my mind—trying my best to hurt
    him.”</p>
<p>“Do him no harm,” said Caroline. “Never worry about what you say to a
    man. They’re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it’s
    unflattering.”</p>
<p>Ursula went on, nervously twisting and untwisting her hands.</p>
<p>“When the murder was discovered and he didn’t come forward, I was
    terribly upset. Just for a moment I wondered—but then I knew he
    couldn’t—he couldn’t.... But I wished he would come forward and say
    openly that he’d had nothing to do with it. I knew that he was very
    fond of Dr. Sheppard, and I fancied that perhaps Dr. Sheppard might
    know where he was hiding.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>
<p>She turned to me.</p>
<p>“That’s why I said what I did to you that day. I thought, if you knew
    where he was, you might pass on the message to him.”</p>
<p>“I?” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Why should James know where he was?” demanded Caroline sharply.</p>
<p>“It was very unlikely, I know,” admitted Ursula, “but Ralph had often
    spoken of Dr. Sheppard, and I knew that he would be likely to consider
    him as his best friend in King’s Abbot.”</p>
<p>“My dear child,” I said, “I have not the least idea where Ralph Paton
    is at the present moment.”</p>
<p>“That is true enough,” said Poirot.</p>
<p>“But——” Ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion.</p>
<p>“Ah! that,” said Poirot, slightly embarrassed; “a <i lang="fr">bagatelle</i>,
    mademoiselle. A <i lang="fr">rien du tout</i>. Not for a moment do I believe that
    Ralph Paton has been arrested.”</p>
<p>“But then——” began the girl slowly.</p>
<p>Poirot went on quickly:—</p>
<p>“There is one thing I should like to know—did Captain Paton wear shoes
    or boots that night?”</p>
<p>Ursula shook her head.</p>
<p>“I can’t remember.”</p>
<p>“A pity! But how should you? Now, madame,” he smiled at her, his head
    on one side, his forefinger wagging eloquently, “no questions. And
    do not torment yourself. Be of good courage, and place your faith in
    Hercule Poirot.”</p>

    you—be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. You’re in my hands for the time being. You’ll stay here for
    the present, anyway—eh, M. Poirot?”</p>
<p>“It will be the best plan,” agreed the little Belgian. “This evening I

    reunion. Nine o’clock at my house. It is most necessary that she should
    be there.”</p>
<p>Caroline nodded, and went with Ursula out of the room. The door shut
    behind them. Poirot dropped down into a chair again.</p>
<p>“So far, so good,” he said. “Things are straightening themselves out.”</p>
<p>“They’re getting to look blacker and blacker against Ralph Paton,” I
    observed gloomily.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>
<p>“Yes, that is so. But it was to be expected, was it not?”</p>
<p>I looked at him, slightly puzzled by the remark. He was leaning back in
    the chair, his eyes half closed, the tips of his fingers just touching
    each other. Suddenly he sighed and shook his head.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend
    Hastings comes over me. That is the friend of whom I spoke to you—the
    one who resides now in the Argentine. Always, when I have had a big
    case, he has been by my side. And he has helped me—yes, often he has
    helped me. For he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth
    unawares—without noticing it himself, <i lang="fr">bien entendu</i>. At times he
    has said something particularly foolish, and behold that foolish remark
    has revealed the truth to me! And then, too, it was his practice to
    keep a written record of the cases that proved interesting.”</p>
<p>I gave a slight embarrassed cough.</p>
<p>“As far as that goes,” I began, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Poirot sat upright in his chair. His eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“But yes? What is it that you would say?”</p>
<p>“Well, as a matter of fact, I’ve read some of Captain Hastings’s
    narratives, and I thought, why not try my hand at something of the same
    kind? Seemed a pity not to—unique opportunity—probably the only time
    I’ll be mixed up with anything of this kind.”</p>
<p>I felt myself getting hotter and hotter, and more and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span> more incoherent,
    as I floundered through the above speech.</p>
<p>Poirot sprang from his chair. I had a moment’s terror that he was going
    to embrace me French fashion, but mercifully he refrained.</p>
<p>“But this is magnificent—you have then written down your impressions of
    the case as you went along?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Epatant!</i>” cried Poirot. “Let me see them—this instant.”</p>
<p>I was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand. I racked my brains
    to remember certain details.</p>
<p>“I hope you won’t mind,” I stammered. “I may have been a
    little—er—<em>personal</em> now and then.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I comprehend perfectly; you have referred to me as comic—as,
    perhaps, ridiculous now and then? It matters not at all. Hastings,
    he also was not always polite. Me, I have the mind above such
    trivialities.”</p>
<p>Still somewhat doubtful, I rummaged in the drawers of my desk and
    produced an untidy pile of manuscript which I handed over to him. With
    an eye on possible publication in the future, I had divided the work
    into chapters, and the night before I had brought it up to date with an
    account of Miss Russell’s visit. Poirot had therefore twenty chapters.</p>
<p>I left him with them.</p>
<p>I was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away, and it was
    past eight o’clock when I got back, to be greeted with a plate of hot
    dinner on a tray, and the announcement that Poirot and my sister had
    supped together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> at half-past seven, and that the former had then gone
    to my workshop to finish his reading of the manuscript.</p>
<p>“I hope, James,” said my sister, “that you’ve been careful in what you
    say about me in it?”</p>
<p>My jaw dropped. I had not been careful at all.</p>
<p>“Not that it matters very much,” said Caroline, reading my expression
    correctly. “M. Poirot will know what to think. He understands me much
    better than you do.”</p>
<p>I went into the workshop. Poirot was sitting by the window. The
    manuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him. He laid his hand on
    it and spoke.</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Eh bien</i>,” he said, “I congratulate you—on your modesty!”</p>
<p>“Oh!” I said, rather taken aback.</p>
<p>“And on your reticence,” he added.</p>
<p>I said “Oh!” again.</p>
<p>“Not so did Hastings write,” continued my friend. “On every page, many,
    many times was the word ‘I.’ What <em>he</em> thought—what <em>he</em> did.
    But you—you have kept your personality in the background; only once or
    twice does it obtrude—in scenes of home life, shall we say?”</p>
<p>I blushed a little before the twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>“What do you really think of the stuff?” I asked nervously.</p>
<p>“You want my candid opinion?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Poirot laid his jesting manner aside.</p>
<p>“A very meticulous and accurate account,” he said kindly. “You have
    recorded all the facts faithfully and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> exactly—though you have shown
    yourself becomingly reticent as to your own share in them.”</p>
<p>“And it has helped you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I may say that it has helped me considerably. Come, we must go
    over to my house and set the stage for my little performance.”</p>
<p>Caroline was in the hall. I think she hoped that she might be invited
    to accompany us. Poirot dealt with the situation tactfully.</p>
<p>“I should much like to have had you present, mademoiselle,” he said
    regretfully, “but at this juncture it would not be wise. See you, all
    these people to-night are suspects. Amongst them, I shall find the
    person who killed Mr. Ackroyd.”</p>
<p>“You really believe that?” I said incredulously.</p>
<p>“I see that you do not,” said Poirot dryly. “Not yet do you appreciate
    Hercule Poirot at his true worth.”</p>
<p>At that minute Ursula came down the staircase.</p>
<p>“You are ready, my child?” said Poirot. “That is good. We will go to
    my house together. Mademoiselle Caroline, believe me, I do everything
    possible to render you service. Good-evening.”</p>
<p>We went out, leaving Caroline, rather like a dog who has been refused a
    walk, standing on the front door step gazing after us.</p>
<p>The sitting-room at The Larches had been got ready. On the table were
    various <em>sirops</em> and glasses. Also a plate of biscuits. Several
    chairs had been brought in from the other room.</p>
<p>Poirot ran to and fro rearranging things. Pulling out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span> a chair here,
    altering the position of a lamp there, occasionally stooping to
    straighten one of the mats that covered the floor. He was specially
    fussy over the lighting. The lamps were arranged in such a way as to
    throw a clear light on the side of the room where the chairs were
    grouped, at the same time leaving the other end of the room, where I
    presumed Poirot himself would sit, in a dim twilight.</p>
<p>Ursula and I watched him. Presently a bell was heard.</p>
<p>“They arrive,” said Poirot. “Good, all is in readiness.”</p>
<p>The door opened and the party from Fernly filed in. Poirot went forward
    and greeted Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora.</p>
<p>“It is most good of you to come,” he said. “And Major Blunt and Mr.
    Raymond.”</p>
<p>The secretary was debonair as ever.</p>
<p>“What’s the great idea?” he said, laughing. “Some scientific machine?
    Do we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heart-beats?
    There is such an invention, isn’t there?”</p>
<p>“I have read of it, yes,” admitted Poirot. “But me, I am old-fashioned.
    I use the old methods. I work only with the little gray cells. Now let
    us begin—but first I have an announcement to make to you all.”</p>
<p>He took Ursula’s hand and drew her forward.</p>
<p>“This lady is Mrs. Ralph Paton. She was married to Captain Paton last
    March.”</p>
<p>A little shriek burst from Mrs. Ackroyd.</p>
<p>“Ralph! Married! Last March! Oh! but it’s absurd. How could he be?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>
<p>She stared at Ursula as though she had never seen her before.</p>
<p>“Married to Bourne?” she said. “Really, M. Poirot, I don’t believe you.”</p>
<p>Ursula flushed and began to speak, but Flora forestalled her.</p>
<p>Going quickly to the other girl’s side, she passed her hand through her
    arm.</p>
<p>“You must not mind our being surprised,” she said. “You see, we had no
    idea of such a thing. You and Ralph have kept your secret very well. I
    am—very glad about it.”</p>
<p>“You are very kind, Miss Ackroyd,” said Ursula in a low voice, “and
    you have every right to be exceedingly angry. Ralph behaved very
    badly—especially to you.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t worry about that,” said Flora, giving her arm a consoling
    little pat. “Ralph was in a corner and took the only way out. I should
    probably have done the same in his place. I do think he might have
    trusted me with the secret, though. I wouldn’t have let him down.”</p>
<p>Poirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly.</p>
<p>“The board meeting’s going to begin,” said Flora. “M. Poirot hints that
    we mustn’t talk. But just tell me one thing. Where is Ralph? You must
    know if any one does.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t,” cried Ursula, almost in a wail. “That’s just it, I
    don’t.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t he detained at Liverpool?” asked Raymond. “It said so in the
    paper.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>
<p>“He is not at Liverpool,” said Poirot shortly.</p>
<p>“In fact,” I remarked, “no one knows where he is.”</p>
<p>“Excepting Hercule Poirot, eh?” said Raymond.</p>
<p>Poirot replied seriously to the other’s banter.</p>
<p>“Me, I know everything. Remember that.”</p>
<p>Geoffrey Raymond lifted his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Everything?” He whistled. “Whew! that’s a tall order.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you can really guess where Ralph Paton is hiding?”
    I asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“You call it guessing. I call it knowing, my friend.”</p>
<p>“In Cranchester?” I hazarded.</p>
<p>“No,” replied Poirot gravely, “not in Cranchester.”</p>
<p>He said no more, but at a gesture from him the assembled party took
    their seats. As they did so, the door opened once more and two other
    people came in and sat down near the door. They were Parker and the
    housekeeper.</p>
<p>“The number is complete,” said Poirot. “Every one is here.”</p>
<p>There was a ring of satisfaction in his tone. And with the sound of it
    I saw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces
    grouped at the other end of the room. There was a suggestion in all
    this as of a trap—a trap that had closed.</p>
<p>Poirot read from a list in an important manner.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora Ackroyd, Major Blunt, Mr. Geoffrey Raymond,
    Mrs. Ralph Paton, John Parker, Elizabeth Russell.”</p>
<p>He laid the paper down on the table.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of all this?” began Raymond.</p>
<p>“The list I have just read,” said Poirot, “is a list of suspected
    persons. Every one of you present had the opportunity to kill Mr.
    Ackroyd——”</p>
<p>With a cry Mrs. Ackroyd sprang up, her throat working.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it,” she wailed. “I don’t like it. I would much prefer to
    go home.”</p>
<p>“You cannot go home, madame,” said Poirot sternly, “until you have
    heard what I have to say.”</p>
<p>He paused a moment, then cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“I will start at the beginning. When Miss Ackroyd asked me to
    investigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Dr.
    Sheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the
    footprints on the window-sill. From there Inspector Raglan took me
    along the path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little
    summer-house, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things—a scrap
    of starched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric
    immediately suggested to me a maid’s apron. When Inspector Raglan
    showed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that
    one of the maids—Ursula Bourne, the parlormaid—had no real alibi.
    According to her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty
    until ten. But supposing that instead she was in the summer-house? If
    so, she must have gone there to meet some one. Now we know from Dr.
    Sheppard that some one from outside <em>did</em> come to the house that
    night—the stranger whom he met just by the gate. At a first glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
    it would seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went
    to the summer-house to meet Ursula Bourne. It was fairly certain that
    he <em>did</em> go to the summer-house because of the goose quill. That
    suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and one who had acquired
    the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where sniffing ‘snow’ is
    more common than in this country. The man whom Dr. Sheppard met had an
    American accent, which fitted in with that supposition.</p>
<p>“But I was held up by one point. <em>The times did not fit.</em> Ursula
    Bourne could certainly not have gone to the summer-house before
    nine-thirty, whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past
    nine. I could, of course, assume that he waited there for half an hour.
    The only alternative supposition was that there had been two separate
    meetings in the summer-house that night. <i lang="fr">Eh bien</i>, as soon as
    I went into that alternative I found several significant facts. I
    discovered that Miss Russell, the housekeeper, had visited Dr. Sheppard
    that morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for
    victims of the drug habit. Taking that in conjunction with the goose
    quill, I assumed that the man in question came to Fernly to meet the
    housekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did Ursula Bourne come
    to the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt. First I found a
    ring—a wedding ring—with ‘From R.’ and a date inside it. Then I learnt
    that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the
    summer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine, and I also heard of
    a certain conversation which had taken place in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> the wood near the
    village that very afternoon—a conversation between Ralph Paton and
    some unknown girl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat
    and orderly manner. A secret marriage, an engagement announced on the
    day of the tragedy, the stormy interview in the wood, and the meeting
    arranged for the summer-house that night.</p>
<p>“Incidentally this proved to me one thing, that both Ralph Paton and
    Ursula Bourne (or Paton) had the strongest motives for wishing Mr.
    Ackroyd out of the way. And it also made one other point unexpectedly
    clear. It could not have been Ralph Paton who was with Mr. Ackroyd in
    the study at nine-thirty.</p>
<p>“So we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime. Who
    was it in the room with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty? Not Ralph Paton,
    who was in the summer-house with his wife. Not Charles Kent, who
    had already left. Who, then? I posed my cleverest—my most audacious
    question: <em>Was any one with him?</em>”</p>
<p>Poirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us,
    drawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit.</p>
<p>Raymond, however, did not seem impressed, and lodged a mild protest.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you’re trying to make me out a liar, M. Poirot, but
    the matter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the
    exact words used. Remember, Major Blunt also heard Mr. Ackroyd talking
    to some one. He was on the terrace outside, and couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> catch the
    words clearly, but he distinctly heard the voices.”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“I have not forgotten,” he said quietly. “But Major Blunt was under the
    impression that it was <em>you</em> to whom Mr. Ackroyd was speaking.”</p>
<p>For a moment Raymond seemed taken aback. Then he recovered himself.</p>
<p>“Blunt knows now that he was mistaken,” he said.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” agreed the other man.</p>
<p>“Yet there must have been some reason for his thinking so,” mused
    Poirot. “Oh! no,” he held up his hand in protest, “I know the reason
    you will give—but it is not enough. We must seek elsewhere. I will put
    it this way. From the beginning of the case I have been struck by one
    thing—the nature of those words which Mr. Raymond overheard. It has
    been amazing to me that no one has commented on them—has seen anything
    odd about them.”</p>
<p>He paused a minute, and then quoted softly:—</p>
<p>“... <i>The calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that I fear
    it is impossible for me to accede to your request.</i> Does nothing
    strike you as odd about that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” said Raymond. “He has frequently dictated letters
    to me, using almost exactly those same words.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” cried Poirot. “That is what I seek to arrive at. Would
    any man use such a phrase in <em>talking</em> to another? Impossible
    that that should be part of a real conversation. Now, if he had been
    dictating a letter——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>
<p>“You mean he was reading a letter aloud,” said Raymond slowly. “Even
    so, he must have been reading to some one.”</p>
<p>“But why? We have no evidence that there was any one else in the room.
    No other voice but Mr. Ackroyd’s was heard, remember.”</p>
<p>“Surely a man wouldn’t read letters of that type aloud to himself—not
    unless he was—well—going balmy.”</p>
<p>“You have all forgotten one thing,” said Poirot softly: “the stranger
    who called at the house the preceding Wednesday.”</p>
<p>They all stared at him.</p>
<p>“But yes,” said Poirot, nodding encouragingly, “on Wednesday. The
    young man was not of himself important. But the firm he represented
    interested me very much.”</p>
<p>“The Dictaphone Company,” gasped Raymond. “I see it now. A dictaphone.
    That’s what you think?”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone, you remember.
    Me, I had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question. Their
    reply is that Mr. Ackroyd <em>did</em> purchase a dictaphone from their
    representative. Why he concealed the matter from you, I do not know.”</p>
<p>“He must have meant to surprise me with it,” murmured Raymond. “He had
    quite a childish love of surprising people. Meant to keep it up his
    sleeve for a day or so. Probably was playing with it like a new toy.
    Yes, it fits in. You’re quite right—no one would use quite those words
    in casual conversation.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>
<p>“It explains, too,” said Poirot, “why Major Blunt thought it was you
    who were in the study. Such scraps as came to him were fragments of
    dictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.
    His conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the
    white figure he had caught a glimpse of. He fancied it was Miss
    Ackroyd. Really, of course, it was Ursula Bourne’s white apron he saw
    as she was stealing down to the summer-house.”</p>
<p>Raymond had recovered from his first surprise.</p>
<p>“All the same,” he remarked, “this discovery of yours, brilliant though
    it is (I’m quite sure I should never have thought of it), leaves the
    essential position unchanged. Mr. Ackroyd was alive at nine-thirty,
    since he was speaking into the dictaphone. It seems clear that the man
    Charles Kent was really off the premises by then. As to Ralph Paton——?”</p>
<p>He hesitated, glancing at Ursula.</p>
<p>Her color flared up, but she answered steadily enough.</p>
<p>“Ralph and I parted just before a quarter to ten. He never went near
    the house, I am sure of that. He had no intention of doing so. The last
    thing on earth he wanted was to face his stepfather. He would have
    funked it badly.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t that I doubt your story for a moment,” explained Raymond.
    “I’ve always been quite sure Captain Paton was innocent. But one has to
    think of a court of law—and the questions that would be asked. He is in
    a most unfortunate position, but if he were to come forward——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>
<p>Poirot interrupted.</p>
<p>“That is your advice, yes? That he should come forward?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. If you know where he is——”</p>
<p>“I perceive that you do not believe that I do know. And yet I have told
    you just now that I know everything. The truth of the telephone call,
    of the footprints on the window-sill, of the hiding-place of Ralph
    Paton——”</p>
<p>“Where is he?” said Blunt sharply.</p>
<p>“Not very far away,” said Poirot, smiling.</p>
<p>“In Cranchester?” I asked.</p>
<p>Poirot turned towards me.</p>
<p>“Always you ask me that. The idea of Cranchester it is with you an
    <i lang="fr">idée fixe</i>. No, he is not in Cranchester. He is—<i>there</i>!”</p>
<p>He pointed a dramatic forefinger. Every one’s head turned.</p>
<p>Ralph Paton was standing in the doorway.</p>

<div class="subhead">RALPH PATON’S STORY</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a very uncomfortable minute for <em>me</em>. I hardly took in what
    happened next, but there were exclamations and cries of surprise! When
    I was sufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was
    going on, Ralph Paton was standing by his wife, her hand in his, and he
    was smiling across the room at me.</p>
<p>Poirot, too, was smiling, and at the same time shaking an eloquent
    finger at me.</p>
<p>“Have I not told you at least thirty-six times that it is useless to
    conceal things from Hercule Poirot?” he demanded. “That in such a case
    he finds out?”</p>
<p>He turned to the others.</p>
<p>“One day, you remember, we held a little séance about a table—just
    the six of us. I accused the other five persons present of concealing
    something from me. Four of them gave up their secret. Dr. Sheppard did
    not give up his. But all along I have had my suspicions. Dr. Sheppard
    went to the Three Boars that night hoping to find Ralph. He did not
    find him there; but supposing, I said to myself, that he met him in the
    street on his way home? Dr. Sheppard was a friend of Captain Paton’s,
    and he had come straight from the scene of the crime. He must know that
    things looked very black against him. Perhaps he knew more than the
    general public did——”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>
<p>“I did,” I said ruefully. “I suppose I might as well make a clean
    breast of things now. I went to see Ralph that afternoon. At first he
    refused to take me into his confidence, but later he told me about his
    marriage, and the hole he was in. As soon as the murder was discovered,
    I realized that once the facts were known, suspicion could not fail to
    attach to Ralph—or, if not to him, to the girl he loved. That night I
    put the facts plainly before him. The thought of having possibly to
    give evidence which might incriminate his wife made him resolve at all
    costs to—to——”</p>
<p>I hesitated, and Ralph filled up the gap.</p>
<p>“To do a bunk,” he said graphically. “You see, Ursula left me to go
    back to the house. I thought it possible that she might have attempted
    to have another interview with my stepfather. He had already been very
    rude to her that afternoon. It occurred to me that he might have so
    insulted her—in such an unforgivable manner—that without knowing what
    she was doing——”</p>
<p>He stopped. Ursula released her hand from his, and stepped back.</p>
<p>“You thought that, Ralph! You actually thought that I might have done
    it?”</p>
<p>“Let us get back to the culpable conduct of Dr. Sheppard,” said Poirot
    dryly. “Dr. Sheppard consented to do what he could to help him. He was
    successful in hiding Captain Paton from the police.”</p>
<p>“Where?” asked Raymond. “In his own house?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, indeed,” said Poirot. “You should ask yourself the question
    that I did. If the good doctor is concealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> the young man, what place
    would he choose? It must necessarily be somewhere near at hand. I think
    of Cranchester. A hotel? No. Lodgings? Even more emphatically, no.
    Where, then? Ah! I have it. A nursing home. A home for the mentally
    unfit. I test my theory. I invent a nephew with mental trouble. I
    consult Mademoiselle Sheppard as to suitable homes. She gives me the
    names of two near Cranchester to which her brother has sent patients. I
    make inquiries. Yes, at one of them a patient was brought there by the
    doctor himself early on Saturday morning. That patient, though known
    by another name, I had no difficulty in identifying as Captain Paton.
    After certain necessary formalities, I was allowed to bring him away.
    He arrived at my house in the early hours of yesterday morning.”</p>
<p>I looked at him ruefully.</p>
<p>“Caroline’s Home Office expert,” I murmured. “And to think I never
    guessed!”</p>
<p>“You see now why I drew attention to the reticence of your manuscript,”
    murmured Poirot. “It was strictly truthful as far as it went—but it did
    not go very far, eh, my friend?”</p>
<p>I was too abashed to argue.</p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard has been very loyal,” said Ralph. “He has stood by me
    through thick and thin. He did what he thought was the best. I see now,
    from what M. Poirot has told me, that it was not really the best. I
    should have come forward and faced the music. You see, in the home, we
    never saw a newspaper. I knew nothing of what was going on.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span></p>
<p>“Dr. Sheppard has been a model of discretion,” said Poirot dryly. “But
    me, I discover all the little secrets. It is my business.”</p>
<p>“Now we can have your story of what happened that night,” said Raymond
    impatiently.</p>
<p>“You know it already,” said Ralph. “There’s very little for me to add.
    I left the summer-house about nine-forty-five, and tramped about the
    lanes, trying to make up my mind as to what to do next—what line to
    take. I’m bound to admit that I’ve not the shadow of an alibi, but I
    give you my solemn word that I never went to the study, that I never
    saw my stepfather alive—or dead. Whatever the world thinks, I’d like
    all of you to believe me.”</p>
<p>“No alibi,” murmured Raymond. “That’s bad. I believe you, of course,
    but—it’s a bad business.”</p>
<p>“It makes things very simple, though,” said Poirot, in a cheerful
    voice. “Very simple indeed.”</p>
<p>We all stared at him.</p>
<p>“You see what I mean? No? Just this—to save Captain Paton the real
    criminal must confess.”</p>
<p>He beamed round at us all.</p>
<p>“But yes—I mean what I say. See now, I did not invite Inspector Raglan
    to be present. That was for a reason. I did not want to tell him all
    that I knew—at least I did not want to tell him to-night.”</p>
<p>He leaned forward, and suddenly his voice and his whole personality
    changed. He suddenly became dangerous.</p>
<p>“I who speak to you—I know the murderer of Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> Ackroyd is in this room
    now. It is to the murderer I speak. <em>To-morrow the truth goes to
    Inspector Raglan.</em> You understand?”</p>
<p>There was a tense silence. Into the midst of it came the old Breton
    woman with a telegram on a salver. Poirot tore it open.</p>
<p>Blunt’s voice rose abrupt and resonant.</p>
<p>“The murderer is amongst us, you say? You know—which?”</p>
<p>Poirot had read the message. He crumpled it up in his hand.</p>
<p>“I know—now.”</p>
<p>He tapped the crumpled ball of paper.</p>
<p>“What is that?” said Raymond sharply.</p>
<p>“A wireless message—from a steamer now on her way to the United States.”</p>
<p>There was a dead silence. Poirot rose to his feet bowing.</p>
<p>“Messieurs et Mesdames, this reunion of mine is at an end.
    Remember—<em>the truth goes to Inspector Raglan in the morning</em>.”</p>

<div class="subhead">THE WHOLE TRUTH</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A slight</span> gesture from Poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest. I
    obeyed, going over to the fire and thoughtfully stirring the big logs
    on it with the toe of my boot.</p>
<p>I was puzzled. For the first time I was absolutely at sea as to
    Poirot’s meaning. For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene
    I had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been
    what he called “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself
    interesting and important. But, in spite of myself, I was forced to
    believe in an underlying reality. There had been real menace in his
    words—a certain indisputable sincerity. But I still believed him to be
    on entirely the wrong tack.</p>
<p>When the door shut behind the last of the party he came over to the
    fire.</p>
<p>“Well, my friend,” he said quietly, “and what do you think of it all?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to think,” I said frankly. “What was the point? Why
    not go straight to Inspector Raglan with the truth instead of giving
    the guilty person this elaborate warning?”</p>
<p>Poirot sat down and drew out his case of tiny Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> cigarettes. He
    smoked for a minute or two in silence. Then:—</p>
<p>“Use your little gray cells,” he said. “There is always a reason behind
    my actions.”</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, and then I said slowly:</p>
<p>“The first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who
    the guilty person is, but that you are sure that he is to be found
    amongst the people here to-night. Therefore your words were intended to
    force a confession from the unknown murderer?”</p>
<p>Poirot nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>“A clever idea, but not the truth.”</p>
<p>“I thought, perhaps, that by making him believe you knew, you might
    force him out into the open—not necessarily by confession. He might try
    to silence you as he formerly silenced Mr. Ackroyd—before you could act
    to-morrow morning.”</p>
<p>“A trap with myself as the bait! <i lang="fr">Merci, mon ami</i>, but I am not
    sufficiently heroic for that.”</p>
<p>“Then I fail to understand you. Surely you are running the risk of
    letting the murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard?”</p>
<p>Poirot shook his head.</p>
<p>“He cannot escape,” he said gravely. “There is only one way out—and
    that way does not lead to freedom.”</p>
<p>“You really believe that one of those people here to-night committed
    the murder?” I asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“Yes, my friend.”</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>There was a silence for some minutes. Then Poirot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span> tossed the stump of
    his cigarette into the grate and began to speak in a quiet, reflective
    tone.</p>
<p>“I will take you the way that I have traveled myself. Step by step
    you shall accompany me, and see for yourself that all the facts point
    indisputably to one person. Now, to begin with, there were two facts
    and one little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my
    attention. The first fact was the telephone call. If Ralph Paton were
    indeed the murderer, the telephone call became meaningless and absurd.
    Therefore, I said to myself, Ralph Paton is not the murderer.</p>
<p>“I satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by any one
    in the house, yet I was convinced that it was amongst those present
    on the fatal evening that I had to look for my criminal. Therefore I
    concluded that the telephone call must have been sent by an accomplice.
    I was not quite pleased with that deduction, but I let it stand for the
    minute.</p>
<p>“I next examined the <em>motive</em> for the call. That was difficult.
    I could only get at it by judging its <em>result</em>. Which was—that
    the murder was discovered that night instead of—in all probability—the
    following morning. You agree with that?”</p>
<p>“Ye-es,” I admitted. “Yes. As you say, Mr. Ackroyd, having given orders
    that he was not to be disturbed, nobody would have been likely to go to
    the study that night.”</p>
<p>“<i lang="fr">Très bien.</i> The affair marches, does it not? But matters were
    still obscure. What was the advantage of having the crime discovered
    that night in preference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> the following morning? The only idea I
    could get hold of was that the murderer, knowing the crime was to be
    discovered at a certain time, could make sure of being present when the
    door was broken in—or at any rate immediately afterwards. And now we
    come to the second fact—the chair pulled out from the wall. Inspector
    Raglan dismissed that as of no importance. I, on the contrary, have
    always regarded it as of supreme importance.</p>
<p>“In your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study.
    If you had it with you this minute you would see that—the chair being
    drawn out in the position indicated by Parker—it would stand in a
    direct line between the door and the window.”</p>
<p>“The window!” I said quickly.</p>
<p>“You, too, have my first idea. I imagined that the chair was drawn
    out so that something connected with the window should not be seen
    by any one entering through the door. But I soon abandoned that
    supposition, for though the chair was a grandfather with a high back,
    it obscured very little of the window—only the part between the sash
    and the ground. No, <i lang="fr">mon ami</i>—but remember that just in front of
    the window there stood a table with books and magazines upon it. Now
    that table <em>was</em> completely hidden by the drawn-out chair—and
    immediately I had my first shadowy suspicion of the truth.</p>
<p>“Supposing that there had been something on that table not intended
    to be seen? Something placed there by the murderer? As yet I had no
    inkling of what that something might be. But I knew certain very
    interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> facts about it. For instance, it was something that the
    murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he
    committed the crime. At the same time it was vital that it should be
    removed as soon as possible after the crime had been discovered. And
    so—the telephone message, and the opportunity for the murderer to be on
    the spot when the body was discovered.</p>
<p>“Now four people were on the scene before the police arrived. Yourself,
    Parker, Major Blunt, and Mr. Raymond. Parker I eliminated at once,
    since at whatever time the crime was discovered, he was the one
    person certain to be on the spot. Also it was he who told me of the
    pulled-out chair. Parker, then, was cleared (of the murder, that is. I
    still thought it possible that he had been blackmailing Mrs. Ferrars).
    Raymond and Blunt, however, remained under suspicion since, if the
    crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning, it was
    quite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to
    prevent the object on the round table being discovered.</p>
<p>“Now what was that object? You heard my arguments to-night in reference
    to the scrap of conversation overheard? As soon as I learned that
    a representative of a dictaphone company had called, the idea of a
    dictaphone took root in my mind. You heard what I said in this room not
    half an hour ago? They all agreed with my theory—but one vital fact
    seems to have escaped them. Granted that a dictaphone was being used by
    Mr. Ackroyd that night—why was no dictaphone found?”</p>
<p>“I never thought of that,” I said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>
<p>“We know that a dictaphone was supplied to Mr. Ackroyd. But no
    dictaphone has been found amongst his effects. So, if something was
    taken from that table—why should not that something be the dictaphone?
    But there were certain difficulties in the way. The attention of every
    one was, of course, focused on the murdered man. I think any one could
    have gone to the table unnoticed by the other people in the room. But
    a dictaphone has a certain bulk—it cannot be slipped casually into
    a pocket. There must have been a receptacle of some kind capable of
    holding it.</p>
<p>“You see where I am arriving? The figure of the murderer is taking
    shape. A person who was on the scene straightway, but who might not
    have been if the crime had been discovered the following morning.
    A person carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be
    fitted——”</p>
<p>I interrupted.</p>
<p>“But why remove the dictaphone? What was the point?”</p>
<p>“You are like Mr. Raymond. You take it for granted that what was heard
    at nine-thirty was Mr. Ackroyd’s voice speaking into a dictaphone. But
    consider this useful invention for a little minute. You dictate into
    it, do you not? And at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it
    on, and the voice speaks again.”</p>
<p>“You mean——” I gasped.</p>
<p>Poirot nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, I mean that. <em>At nine-thirty Mr. Ackroyd was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> already dead.</em>
    It was the dictaphone speaking—not the man.”</p>
<p>“And the murderer switched it on. Then he must have been in the room at
    that minute?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. But we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical
    device having been applied—something after the nature of a time lock,
    or even of a simple alarm clock. But in that case we must add two
    qualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer. It must be
    some one who knew of Mr. Ackroyd’s purchase of the dictaphone and also
    some one with the necessary mechanical knowledge.</p>
<p>“I had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on
    the window ledge. Here there were three conclusions open to me. (1)
    They might really have been made by Ralph Paton. He had been at Fernly
    that night, and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle
    dead there. That was one hypothesis. (2) There was the possibility that
    the footmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to
    have the same kind of studs in his shoes. But the inmates of the house
    had shoes soled with crepe rubber, and I declined to believe in the
    coincidence of some one from outside having the same kind of shoes as
    Ralph Paton wore. Charles Kent, as we know from the barmaid of the Dog
    and Whistle, had on a pair of boots ‘clean dropping off him.’ (3) Those
    prints were made by some one deliberately trying to throw suspicion
    on Ralph Paton. To test this last conclusion, it was necessary to
    ascertain certain facts. One pair of Ralph’s shoes had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> obtained
    from the Three Boars by the police. Neither Ralph nor any one else
    could have worn them that evening, since they were downstairs being
    cleaned. According to the police theory, Ralph was wearing another pair
    of the same kind, and I found out that it was true that he had two
    pairs. Now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the
    murderer to have worn Ralph’s shoes that evening—in which case Ralph
    must have been wearing yet a <em>third</em> pair of footwear of some
    kind. I could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes
    all alike—the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots. I
    got your sister to make inquiries on this point—laying some stress on
    the color, in order—I admit it frankly—to obscure the real reason for
    my asking.</p>
<p>“You know the result of her investigations. Ralph Paton <em>had</em> had
    a pair of boots with him. The first question I asked him when he came
    to my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on
    the fatal night. He replied at once that he had worn <em>boots</em>—he
    was still wearing them, in fact—having nothing else to put on.</p>
<p>“So we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person
    who had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton’s from the
    Three Boars that day.”</p>
<p>He paused, and then said, with a slightly raised voice:—</p>
<p>“There is one further point. The murderer must have been a person who
    had the opportunity to purloin that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> dagger from the silver table. You
    might argue that any one in the house might have done so, but I will
    recall to you that Miss Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was
    not there when she examined the silver table.”</p>
<p>He paused again.</p>
<p>“Let us recapitulate—now that all is clear. A person who was at the
    Three Boars earlier that day, a person who knew Ackroyd well enough
    to know that he had purchased a dictaphone, a person who was of a
    mechanical turn of mind, who had the opportunity to take the dagger
    from the silver table before Miss Flora arrived, who had with him a
    receptacle suitable for hiding the dictaphone—such as a black bag, and
    who had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was
    discovered while Parker was telephoning for the police. In fact—<em>Dr. Sheppard!</em>”</p>

<div class="subhead">AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a dead silence for a minute and a half.</p>
<p>Then I laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re mad,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” said Poirot placidly. “I am not mad. It was the little
    discrepancy in time that first drew my attention to you—right at the
    beginning.”</p>
<p>“Discrepancy in time?” I queried, puzzled.</p>
<p>“But yes. You will remember that every one agreed—you yourself
    included—that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the
    house—less if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the
    house at ten minutes to nine—both by your own statement and that of
    Parker, and yet it was nine o’clock as you passed through the lodge
    gates. It was a chilly night—not an evening a man would be inclined
    to dawdle; why had you taken ten minutes to do a five-minutes’ walk?
    All along I realized that we had only your statement for it that the
    study window was ever fastened. Ackroyd asked you if you had done
    so—he never looked to see. Supposing, then, that the study window was
    unfastened? Would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run
    round the outside of the house, change your shoes, climb in through
    the window, kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span> o’clock? I
    decided against that theory since in all probability a man as nervous
    as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in, and then there
    would have been a struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd
    <em>before</em> you left—as you were standing beside his chair? Then you
    go out of the front door, run round to the summer-house, take Ralph
    Paton’s shoes out of the bag you brought up with you that night, slip
    them on, walk through the mud in them, and leave prints on the window
    ledge, you climb in, lock the study door on the inside, run back to the
    summer-house, change back into your own shoes, and race down to the
    gate. (I went through similar actions the other day, when you were with
    Mrs. Ackroyd—it took ten minutes exactly.) Then home—and an alibi—since
    you had timed the dictaphone for half-past nine.”</p>
<p>“My dear Poirot,” I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to
    my own ears, “you’ve been brooding over this case too long. What on
    earth had I to gain by murdering Ackroyd?”</p>
<p>“Safety. It was you who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Who could have had
    a better knowledge of what killed Mr. Ferrars than the doctor who was
    attending him? When you spoke to me that first day in the garden,
    you mentioned a legacy received about a year ago. I have been unable
    to discover any trace of a legacy. You had to invent some way of
    accounting for Mrs. Ferrars’s twenty thousand pounds. It has not done
    you much good. You lost most of it in speculation—then you put the
    screw on too hard, and Mrs. Ferrars took a way out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> that you had not
    expected. If Ackroyd had learnt the truth he would have had no mercy on
    you—you were ruined for ever.”</p>
<p>“And the telephone call?” I asked, trying to rally. “You have a
    plausible explanation of that also, I suppose?”</p>
<p>“I will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when
    I found that a call had actually been put through to you from King’s
    Abbot station. I at first believed that you had simply invented the
    story. It was a very clever touch, that. You must have some excuse for
    arriving at Fernly, finding the body, and so getting the chance to
    remove the dictaphone on which your alibi depended. I had a very vague
    notion of how it was worked when I came to see your sister that first
    day and inquired as to what patients you had seen on Friday morning. I
    had no thought of Miss Russell in my mind at that time. Her visit was a
    lucky coincidence, since it distracted your mind from the real object
    of my questions. I found what I was looking for. Among your patients
    that morning was the steward of an American liner. Who more suitable
    than he to be leaving for Liverpool by the train that evening? And
    afterwards he would be on the high seas, well out of the way. I noted
    that the <cite>Orion</cite> sailed on Saturday, and having obtained the name
    of the steward I sent him a wireless message asking a certain question.
    This is his reply you saw me receive just now.”</p>
<p>He held out the message to me. It ran as follows—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>
<p>“Quite correct. Dr. Sheppard asked me to leave a note at a patient’s
    house. I was to ring him up from the station with the reply. Reply was
    ‘No answer.’”</p>
<div class="center">*<span class="col3">*</span>
<span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span><span class="col3">*</span></div>
<p>“It was a clever idea,” said Poirot. “The call was genuine. Your sister
    saw you take it. But there was only one man’s word as to what was
    actually said—your own!”</p>
<p>I yawned.</p>
<p>“All this,” I said, “is very interesting—but hardly in the sphere of
    practical politics.”</p>
<p>“You think not? Remember what I said—the truth goes to Inspector Raglan
    in the morning. But, for the sake of your good sister, I am willing to
    give you the chance of another way out. There might be, for instance,
    an overdose of a sleeping draught. You comprehend me? But Captain Ralph
    Paton must be cleared—<i lang="fr">ça va sans dire</i>. I should suggest that you
    finish that very interesting manuscript of yours—but abandoning your
    former reticence.”</p>
<p>“You seem to be very prolific of suggestions,” I remarked. “Are you
    sure you’ve quite finished.”</p>
<p>“Now that you remind me of the fact, it is true that there is one thing
    more. It would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as
    you silenced M. Ackroyd. That kind of business does not succeed against
    Hercule Poirot, you understand.”</p>
<p>“My dear Poirot,” I said, smiling a little, “whatever else I may be, I
    am not a fool.”</p>
<p>I rose to my feet.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>
<p>“Well, well,” I said, with a slight yawn, “I must be off home. Thank

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Five</span> a.m. I am very tired—but I have finished my task. My arm aches
    from writing.</p>
<p>A strange end to my manuscript. I meant it to be published some day as
    the history of one of Poirot’s failures! Odd, how things pan out.</p>
<p>All along I’ve had a premonition of disaster, from the moment I saw
    Ralph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars with their heads together. I thought
    then that she was confiding in him; as it happened I was quite wrong
    there, but the idea persisted even after I went into the study with
    Ackroyd that night, until he told me the truth.</p>
<p>Poor old Ackroyd. I’m always glad that I gave him a chance. I urged him
    to read that letter before it was too late. Or let me be honest—didn’t
    I subconsciously realize that with a pig-headed chap like him, it was
    my best chance of getting him <em>not</em> to read it? His nervousness
    that night was interesting psychologically. He knew danger was close at
    hand. And yet he never suspected <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>The dagger was an afterthought. I’d brought up a very handy little
    weapon of my own, but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table,
    it occurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon
    that couldn’t be traced to me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>
<p>I suppose I must have meant to murder him all along. As soon as I heard
    of Mrs. Ferrars’s death, I felt convinced that she would have told him
    everything before she died. When I met him and he seemed so agitated,
    I thought that perhaps he knew the truth, but that he couldn’t bring
    himself to believe it, and was going to give me the chance of refuting
    it.</p>
<p>So I went home and took my precautions. If the trouble were after all
    only something to do with Ralph—well, no harm would have been done. The
    dictaphone he had given me two days before to adjust. Something had
    gone a little wrong with it, and I persuaded him to let me have a go at
    it, instead of sending it back. I did what I wanted to it, and took it
    up with me in my bag that evening.</p>
<p>I am rather pleased with myself as a writer. What could be neater, for
    instance, than the following:—</p>
<p>“<i>The letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just
    on ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I
    hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering
    if there was anything I had left undone.</i>”</p>
<p>All true, you see. But suppose I had put a row of stars after the first
    sentence! Would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in
    that blank ten minutes?</p>
<p>When I looked round the room from the door, I was quite satisfied.
    Nothing had been left undone. The dictaphone was on the table by the
    window, timed to go off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span> at nine-thirty (the mechanism of that little
    device was rather clever—based on the principle of an alarm clock), and
    the arm-chair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.</p>
<p>I must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just
    outside the door. I have faithfully recorded that fact.</p>
<p>Then later, when the body was discovered, and I had sent Parker to
    telephone for the police, what a judicious use of words: “<em>I did
    what little had to be done!</em>” It was quite little—just to shove
    the dictaphone into my bag and push back the chair against the wall
    in its proper place. I never dreamed that Parker would have noticed
    that chair. Logically, he ought to have been so agog over the body
    as to be blind to everything else. But I hadn’t reckoned with the
    trained-servant complex.</p>
<p>I wish I could have known beforehand that Flora was going to say she’d
    seen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten. That puzzled me more than
    I can say. In fact, all through the case there have been things that
    puzzled me hopelessly. Every one seems to have taken a hand.</p>
<p>My greatest fear all through has been Caroline. I have fancied she
    might guess. Curious the way she spoke that day of my “strain of
    weakness.”</p>
<p>Well, she will never know the truth. There is, as Poirot said, one way
    out....</p>
<p>I can trust him. He and Inspector Raglan will manage it between them. I
    should not like Caroline to know. She is fond of me, and then, too, she
    is proud....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span> My death will be a grief to her, but grief passes....</p>
<p>When I have finished writing, I shall enclose this whole manuscript in
    an envelope and address it to Poirot.</p>
<p>And then—what shall it be? Veronal? There would be a kind of poetic
    justice. Not that I take any responsibility for Mrs. Ferrars’s death.
    It was the direct consequence of her own actions. I feel no pity for her.</p>
<p>I have no pity for myself either.</p>
<p>So let it be veronal.</p>
<p>But I wish Hercule Poirot had never retired from work and come here to
    grow vegetable marrows.</p>

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
